            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

VVe knowe wel enough, what kynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Lord hath generallie ſhewed vnto our kingdome at ſuch time as we little deſerued the ſame, and what thankfulneſſe wee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed him again, our practiſe doth evidentlie teſtifie.</p>
            <p>It is not yet manie yeares aboue 30. ſince we were matched, yea,
<note place="margin">King Philips mariage.</note> and ouermatched with ſtrangers, readie daye and night to haue the ſame crueltie ſhevved vpon vs, whiche that proude and bloodie nation the Spainyard, doth now the ſecond tyme purpoſe to execute. But our God deliuered vs from that imminent bondage. The bleſſing is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bred, eſpeciallie ſeeing the kindenes was then ſhewed vnto our ſtate, when not onelye the whole kingdome being moſte ſhamefullie fallen from God to the worſhip of deuils, was ouergrowne with the weeds of Idolatrous poperie and ſuperſtition: but euen thoſe plantes graffed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs by the diuels owne hande, were ſo highly accounted off, that rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould not haue their ful growth in England, they were watered with the blood of the ſaints of God. Behold here, O England, thy deliueraunce from bondage, in the day wherein thou didſt deſerue captitutie, and looke for an heauier yoke, if thou continueſt to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful. But what do I ſpeake of this outward libertie, ſeeing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther freedome of the ſoule beſtowed vpon vs at the ſame inſtant, doth vtterlie obſcure this bleſſing, and make it ſeeme nothing in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Lord therefore, that al the glorie of his kindnes towardes a rebellious nation might indeede be his owne, and that he might juſtly require the fruit of thankfulneſſe at our handes, together with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of hir right excellent Majeſtie, brought vnto vs the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſure of his Goſpell, which to this day he hath continued contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto our deſerts. Howe this goſpell was at that time, and nowe is receaued among vs, it ſhalbe partlie declared afterward.</p>
            <p>Since the enjoying thereof (how vnthankfullie ſoeuer our ſtate hath
<pb facs="tcp:22816:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>entertayned the ſame) it is well knowen that in regarde of outwarde peace and proſperitie, this land hath bene in our dayes the miracle of al the kingdomes in the earth. For the Lord hath from heauen comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the bleſsing of outward plentie to be with vs in al that we haue ſet our handes vnto:
<note place="margin">Deu. 28.11.12</note> and as for our peace, it hath beene ſuch as other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue bene glad to borrow the ſame from vs, which alſo we haue bene able to lend vnto them. And although the Lord to teſtify his wrath againſt the abuſe of his bleſſings hath ſomtimes chaſtened vs with ſome taſte of famine, and threatned diuers times to take awaye our peace, yet whenſoeuer wee haue had but one deare yeare in all our quarters, hee fullie recompenſed the dearth thereof, with the vnexpected abundance and plentie of the next. And if you look vnto our enemies that haue ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen vp, either at home or abroad to diſturbe our quietnes, they may bee trulie ſaide to come againſt vs one waye, and to haue fallen before vs ſeauen. So that if within the circuite of heauen, you woulde ſee a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wonderfullie bleſſed with outward peace and proſperity, Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d muſt be the pattern thereof. And I woulde to God that this were the onelie preſident that England doth afforde vnto vs and our poſterities? But alas, it is far other wiſe. For as the Lords bleſſings haue bene mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied vpon vs, ſo hath our vnthankfulneſſe augmented it ſenſe out of meaſure. Conſider the ſtate of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this day, &amp; ſee what a grateful cuntrie Englande hath bene vnto hir God. The Lord by the mouthes of his ſeruantes, and by his fore-named bleſſings, hath theſe 31. yeares beſought and earneſtly intreated, yea wooed as it were al eſtates among vs, to looke vnto their owne ſoules to day, wrile it is called to day, and to lay a ſure hold vpon him while he may be found, by a thorow recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Goſpel: together with the miniſters thereof: and by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindenes vnto his deſolate houſe. But what hath England anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Surelie with an impudent fore-head The hath ſaid: <q>I wil not come neere the holie one.
<note place="margin">Englands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> And as for the building of his houſe, I will not ſo much as lift vp a finger towardes that work, nay I wil continue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations thereof. And if anie man ſpeaketh a worde in the behalfe of this houſe, or bewaileth the miſerie of it: I wil accounte him an enemye to my ſtate. As for the goſpel, and the miniſteries of it, I haue already receaued al the Goſpels, and al the miniſteries that I meane to receaue. I haue receaued a reading Goſpel, and a reading miniſtery, a pompous Goſpel, and a pompous miniſtery: a Goſpel and a miniſtery that ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth the hands of the wicked in his iniquity, a goſpel and a miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that will ſtoupe vnto me and bee at my beek either to ſpeake or to be mute when I ſhal thinke good. Briefly I haue receaued a goſpel &amp; a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie that wil neuer trouble my conſcience with the ſight of my ſinns which is al the goſpels and al the miniſteries that I meane to receaue: &amp; I wil make a ſure hand, that the Lords houſe it I can chuſe, ſhalbee no otherwayes aedified, than by the handes of ſuche men, as bring vnto me the foreſaid goſpel and the foreſaid miniſtery.</q> Loe heere Englands thankfulnes (beloued) foral the mercies and kindnes whiche hir God hath vouchſaued vnto hir. And tell me in thy conſcience whether thou thinkeſt that ſhee hath rendred according vnto the rewarde beſtowed vpon hir,
<note place="margin">2. Chro. 32.25</note> who in ſo great a deſolation of Gods ſervice, hath not once
<pb facs="tcp:22816:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhewed hir ſelf to be moued with any compaſsion that way. And I doe apeale vnto thy conſcience, whether I haue not trulie ſet down the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which all eſtates among vs generallie conſidered doe beare vnto the Lords pure worſhip and ſeruice. In ſo much as if he ſhoulde ſende ſome Ieremy to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in our high wayes, &amp; inquire whatſort of men he could finde within our land, who had in any thankful manner remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the Lords goodenes, by regarding his waſt and ruinous ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, well hee might meete with ſome one heere and there, as a cluſter of grapes after the vintage, that in ſome gratefull ſort, acknowledged the Lords hand towards vs: but as for the general ſtate either of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, of the miniſterye or of the common people, behelde nothing els, but a multitude of conſpirators againſt God, againſt his truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the building of his houſe, againſt his Saints and children: and conſequentlie againſt the wealth of their owne ſoules, and the publike peace and tranquillity of this whole kingdome.
<note place="margin">Our common people.</note> Concerning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, their profanneſſe, impiety, contempt of God and his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and their hatred vnto his children, with al other their wickednes, may ſeeme to deſerue ſome excuſe,
<note place="margin">Ier. 5.3.4.</note> becauſe they never as yet had anye meanes to know God aright, for the holy ghoſt may truly ſay of them They are poore, they are fooliſh, for they haue not knowen the way of the Lord, nor the judgements of their God. And therefore what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell is it, thoughe they have made their faces harder than a ſtone, and refuſed to returne.</p>
            <p>But theſe that would be accounted our Prophetes,
<note place="margin">Our ſuppoſed Miniſtery.</note> and the miniſters of the Sanctuary, haue had better meanes to know the wil of their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and therefore juſt &amp; righteous ſhal he be, whenſoeuer he rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them with the fruites of their owne handes, if they haue broken the yoak: of their obedience, and caſte from them the bondes of that carefulnes, whereby it behoued them to binde themſelues, that they ſhould not forget the houſe of their God. VVil you then come vnto them, and ſee what they are? Alas, you can beholde heere no other ſight but a multitude of deſperate and forlorne Athieſts, that haue put the euil day far from them, and endeuoured to perſwade their owne hartes, that gods holy miniſtery, and the ſauing health of mens ſoules, are matters not to be regarded. You ſhal finde among this crue, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but a troup of bloody ſoule murtherers, ſacriligious church robbers, and ſuche as haue made them ſelues fatte with the bloude of mens ſoules, and the vtter ruine of the Church. The whole endeuour of which curſed generation, ever ſince the beginning of hir Maieſties raigne, hath tended no otherway, then to make a ſure hand to keepe the church in bondage, that being bound in their handes, it ſhoulde not dare for feare of being murthered to ſeeke for liberty. Of theſe men, contained within the nomber of proud and ambitious prelates, our Lord Archbiſhops and Biſhops, godleſſe and murthering Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes, profane and ignorant idole ſhepheards, or dumbe doggs, <q>I will ſay no more in this place but this.

And therefore hande in hande, haue our magiſtracye and miniſterye walked in the contempt of true Religion. And the one of theſe hauing vncircumciſed eares, haue made that the other cannot hearken, and vnto both the word of the Lorde, (in which they haue no delight) is made a reproche: Inſomuch as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe who deale in the cauſe of juſtice, there are founde wicked perſons,
<note place="margin">Ier. 5.26.27.</note> as the prophete ſaieth, even wicked lawyers and judges (who ſeeme to know of no other God, but their owne gaine,) that lay waite for the bloud of Gods ſaints, as hee that ſetteth ſnares, and mark whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can heare of any that goe further in the cauſe of God, than the corruption of our ſtate doth permit. And if they finde any ſuch, they know how to wreſt againſt them, a clawſe of ſome ſtatute, contrarye not onely to the meaning thereof, but even contrary vnto all juſtice &amp; aequity, yea common reaſon it ſelfe, and the very groundes of al good Lawes, and ſtatutes. So that it is now growne, and hath beene of a long time a common practiſe of theſe godles men, to make of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes ordained for the maintenance of Religion and common quietnes a pit wherein to catch the peaceable of the land. The common endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the Lords true and faithful miniſters for matters of trifles, as the omiſsion of the ſurpliſe, Churching of women, Croſſe in baptiſm &amp;c. doeth manifeſtlye witnes the iniquity of theſe Atheiſtes.

            <p>But to returne again vnto our purpoſe, if the accuſation wherwith I am vniuſtly charged in the former warrant, reached no farther then my owne perſon, it were my dutye in regarde of the quietnes of our ſtate, to put it vp: But ſeing that it doth not touch me at al, any further then
<pb facs="tcp:22816:5"/>I haue bene an inſtrument to promote the cauſe of Chriſts governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and wholly ſtriketh at that truth, in the defence whereof it pleaſed the Lord to vſe my weake and polluted hands: I do make it knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlde. Firſte that I am accounted an enemye vnto our ſtate, for no other ſuſpition and colour, but onely becauſe I haue by publicke writing, laboured to defend and induce in our churche, that vniforme order of church regiment, which our Sauiour Chriſt hath ordained in his word, to continue perpetually therein: and alſo haue endeuored to ſeek the vtter ruine and ouerthrow of that wicked hierarchye of lorde Biſhops, together with whatſoever corruption dependeth therevpon. Nowe that I cannot bee charged of enmitye to our ſtate, for any other cauſe than this which I haue expreſſed: I make it clear, in that my brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp hauing bene al the dayes of my life at my ſtudies, I never as yet delt in any cauſe more or leſſe, that any wayes concerneth the civil ſtate and government. And as for attempting any thing againſt hir maieſties perſon, I know the diuel himſelf dares not be ſo ſhameles as to intende any accuſation againſt me in that point.

I do in the ſecond place make it known by this preſent treatiſe, that the ſincere handling of this cauſe is ſo far from being an enemye vnto our ſtate: that they do notably detect their impiety againſt God, and their enmity to the kingdom of his ſonne Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Our perſecuters are enemies to the ſtate of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> whoſoever they be that dare preſume to burden, either the cauſe or the ſincere profeſſors thereof, with ſo palpable and manifeſt a ſclaunder, And as for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury, that heerein they offer vnto hir Maieſtye, who woulde by theſe ſclaunders enforce hir to lay down hir peaceable ſcepter, and to take vp a bloody ſword againſt hir beſt ſubiects: our bloud (though they never haue power to ſpill it) which they thirſt after, ſhal in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment teſtify the ſame to their condemnation, except they repent. And hir Maieſty, if ſhee giue eare vnto ſuch counſellors is to feare, leaſte in the Lords juſt judgement the day maye come vpon hir and hir Lande, (which in thy mercies Lord remoue far from hir) wherein ſhe ſhal full bitterly lament and bewaile,
<note place="margin">Enemies to hir Maieſty.</note> that in time ſhe tooke not greater tryall of our loyaity, who now are reckened within the nomber of hir moſte dangerous ſubiects, So that the iniury by the former vniuſt accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, offered vnto Gods cauſe and vs his people, ſtryketh alſo at hir Maieſſies owne eſtate And the Lord vouchafe hir an harte to conſider thereof, before it bee too late. For aſſuredly thoſe that are our enemies for the profeſſion of the truth, cannot be hir ſure fiends, whatſoever they may pretend.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I ſee that we be fallen into thoſe times, wherein Sathan worketh the defacing of the waye of truthe, and ſupporteth his owne kingdome by inſtrumentes of no meane countenance: and alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue that baſe man beginneth to take ſtrength vnto himſelfe againſte his maker: I haue purpoſely framed my ſelfe to make it knowne vnto Sathan and his complices that all their might and power in oppugning vs for this cauſe is ſpent in vaine. For although the cauſe bee ſtood vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by weake and ſinful men, if reſpect bee had to that which wee are in
<pb facs="tcp:22816:5"/>ourſelues, I yet let man know that in the ſtrength of our God, we are ſo far from being diſmayed with the wiſedom, countenance, or power of whatſoeuer is made of fleſh, that for mine owne part, I cannot ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently wonder, that any creature dares be ſo bold, as to proclaime war againſt vs for this cauſe. And therefore whatſoever enemies the Lorde bath raiſed vp againſt me (a contemptible worme,) for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his truth, be they noble or vnnoble, counſellors or inferiour men, I am ſo far from fearing their power, that the more I ſee them rage, the greater ſtrength I ſee reached vnto me by the Lords free mercies to ſtand to that truth, which they raue againſt. And by how much the more I ſee them banded againſt the ſonne of God, by ſo muche the greater hope do I conceaue, that the caſe wherein I ſtand, ſhal get the vpper hande over them, whether they wil or not. I beleeue, and therefore I am forced to ſpeak theſe things. In the vttering whereof, as I thank my God, I haue a feeling of mine own great wants and imperfections: ſo I am not with out ſome comfortable aſſurance of his hand with me in this cauſe, to ſeale whatſoever truth I ſhal vtter heerin, according to his word. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect wherof, I do warne and admoniſh thoſe counſellors with whom and againſt whome, eſpecially I deale in this treatiſe, to repent them of their great inſolency, whereby they haue bene puffed vp with Senacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib to magnifie and oppoſe themſelues againſt the cauſe and people of the Lord of Hoſtes:
<note place="margin">2. Chron. 32.19. Zeph. 2.8.9 10.</note> as againſt the religion and people of ſome of the gods of the earth. Otherwayes they are to feare, leaſt the Lord hauing rayſed vp many of them, out of meane places into the throne of juſtice, meaneth to ſhew his power and great name, by making them examples of his feareful wrath as he did Pharaoh, who wrought his owne ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw as the * text expreſly noteth:

<note place="margin">pſal. 75.3.8.11</note> he wil break the horne of the wicked and the righteous ſhalbe exalted. If men wil wonder that wee being ſo contemptible in the ſight of the world, dare yet be ſo bold, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole great ſtates and mighty men, and to challenge them of iniuſtice againſt the ſonne of God and his members, who wil not ſtick to bragge with Pilate, that they haue power to crucifie Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Iohn. 19.10.</note> and to abſolue him they are to vnderſtand, that we know of no power, but from aboue: &amp; therefore of no power, that is able to beare out iniuſtice and wrong: the hilles of the robbers we grant to be high,
<note place="margin">Iob. 5.3.</note> and vnaſſaileable in the ſight of an eye of fleſh: but we haue learned of the holy man, to account the habitation of the wicked to be accurſed even when he ſemeth to be beſt rooted: for we know that the ſteppes of his ſtrength ſhalbee reſtrained,
<note place="margin">Iob. 18.7.</note> and that his owne counſel ſhal caſt him downe. And as for our ſelues, we confes that we are but baſe worms, (and we would to God that we were lower in our own eyes,) ſuch as liue not according vnto outward appearance, becauſe our life is hid with Chriſt in God.

<note place="margin">Heb. 11.16.</note> And we are ſo far from hunting after the wages of vnrighteouſnes with them, that we freely confes our ſelues to bee but pilgrimes and ſtraungers vpon earth: and therefore travell towardes that heavenly city which our God hath prepared for vs. To be briefe, we are the law full ſucceſſors of thoſe men, who through faith quenched the violence of fire,

VVherrwith alſo we hope to be aſſiſted, whenſoever it ſhal pleaſe the Lord to giue our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies leaue to try our pacience.

<note place="margin">Heb. 13 5.6.</note> I wil not fayle thee, nor forſake thee. So that we may boldly ſay, the lord is mine helper, neither wil I feare what man can do vnto me.</p>
            <p>If then our counſellers and great men wil not provoke this God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their owne ſoules, they are to be exhorted before they deale any farther againſt the procurers of reformation, to betake them vnto their ſecond thoughtes, and acknowledge their temeritye in lifting vp their handes againſt God and thoſe whome hee accounteth of, as the apple of his owne eye.

            <p>To come vnto you beloved, for whoſe ſtrengthening and comforting I haue eſpecially taken paines in this treatiſe, if God hath called any of you to ſuffer for this cauſe, think it an exceding preferment that he hath vouchſaued you to be partakers of the afflictions of the goſpel,
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.8.</note> and in any caſe be not diſmaied at your trobles.

I haue alſo ſhewed it to be that cauſe, which is compaſſed about with a cloude of wi neſſes, and made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and bewtiful vnto al chriſtians, with the blood of the holye Martyrs of Chriſt. The ſame ſpirit which aſsiſted them vnto the end, wil not leaue you in any of your temptations. So that by your prayers you ſeek vnto the Lord for ſtrength,
<note place="margin">Obedience.</note> and be careful to learne obedience by the things which you ſuffer.

            <p>Concerning ſuch of you as the Lord hath not tryed with any afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for this cauſe, I beſeech you be not aſhamed of the chaine of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,

VVe know that conſidering the ſeaſon, it is now time to reſt from ſleep.
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.12.</note> For now is our ſalvation neerer than when we firſte beleved. It might haue bene ſomething tollerable in times paſt for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere profeſſor, to haue an ignorant, an vntaughte, and a vnreformed family: but in this cleare light,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.27. 1. cor. 13.5.13 Zeph. 1.8. Epheſ. 5.11.

Long haire, great ruffes, laying out of wemens haire, and ſtrange attyre, is a participating with the vnfruitful works of darkneſſe and a token that the goſpel hath not beene faithfully receaued. And therefore let it be no longer tolle rated among the reformed profeſſours of England. Vow and performe with the holye man Dauid,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 111.12.</note> that you wil ſing mercy and judgement, &amp; walke in the vprightnes of your harts in the midſt of your families,
<note place="margin">Iob. 22.22.23.</note> and if you wil make peace indeede with the Lord, follow the counſel of the holye ghoſt in removing iniquitye far, not only from yourſelues, but alſo from your tabernacles &amp; hou ſes. Shew what reformation can do in a whole kingdome, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe thereof in your owne perſons and families. And that wilbe the beſt argument both to confute the aduerſary, and to draw the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to lyke the cauſe. And as the Lord ſhal giue vnto any of you acceſſe either vnto hir Maieſty, or any of their Honors, ſo be careful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this truth. VVe haue al of vs (we muſt confes,) be ne ſo careleſſe and ſecure in theſe points, and therefore it is, that by the juſte judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, our Biſhops are at this day ſo inſolent againſt the truth. And vnles we labour more ſtrongly to haue theſe Cananits rooted out we may write vpon it, that they wilbe prickes in our eyes,
<note place="margin">Nomb. 33.55.56.</note> &amp; thornes in our ſides, &amp; ſtil vexe vs as they do at this day. VVhere I ſay that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors ſhould labour ſtrongly, to haue our hierarchy and contemptible Idoles rooted out of our Church, my meaning is not that any priuate ſtrength ſhould ſo much as lift vp a hand, muche leſſe vſe any violence againſt theſe caterpillers: but I meane that we ſhould more veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour with the Lord by prayers, and by the reforming ourſelues &amp; our families, and deale earneſtly with hir Maieſty &amp; their Honors that our cauſe may be aequally heard.</p>
            <p>My meaning in the former point I thought needful to expreſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know what ſclanders would otherwiſe be raiſed againſt me, to the hurt of the cauſe by thoſe that are enemies therevnto: whoſe mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (I doubte not) will ſhortlye appeare vnto all men. And I truſt in the Lord, that he wil one day giue hir Maieſty a deſcerning ey, to judge aright between them and vs, and then ſhal it appeare, whether we or they do ſeek the peace and quietnes of hir kingdome. In the meane time we wil content our ſelues with the eye of our God. Yet one thing I would wiſh to be conſidered of by hir right excellent Maieſty, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether it be not an inconvenient ſeaſon when our fortaine enemies are at the dores, publikly to traduce hir beſte and moſt truſty ſnbiects as enemies to hir ſtate. For if the Spainyard ſhal heare, that (beſids the

<note place="margin">Mark the iſſue.</note> what wil not the hope of a threfold diſcorde in our ſtate moue him to attempt? I doe therefore feare that many of the forwardeſt enemies of reformation, are not the backwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt friends that the King of Spaine hath in England at this day. But leaſt the enemy ſhould deceaue himſelf, with a golden dreame: I am to make it knowen vnto al Spaniards and Spaniſh practiſers, that we are ſuch enemies vnto Queene Elizabeth,

The which point I take to be ſo cleare and manifeſt that no ſtate-men can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, ſaue only thoſe who haue made a leagne with the diuell &amp; a covenant with hell; by vertue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they ſtand bound to account the Lord and al his holy wayes to be enemies vnto them and their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed proceedings. For no man can pretend the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and word of God to be his enemie, but he muſt needs alſo confeſſe, that he hath bidden defyance vnto the Lord of heauen &amp; earth, who accounteth himſelfe to be loved and hated of men, according vnto the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they bear vnto his
<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 12 26. Iohn 14.23.15 1. Iohn. 2.5.</note> word. This hatred of God &amp; his word, becauſe th'aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of reformation in England dare not avowe,
<pb facs="tcp:22816:8"/>therefore as a foundation of the whole treatize fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing I lay downe this ground, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wil not call in queſtion. Namely: That the reformation whiche at this daye wee endevour to bringe into our Churche, is moſte vnjuſtly and wrongfully accounted an enemie vnto our ſtate, if it can bee prooved to be a matter approoued off, and maintayned by the worde and goſpell of IESVS CHRISTE. Where I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowe two thinges of them. Firſt whether they judge that which we labour for to be according to to the worde or no? They muſt anſwere, that they cannot ſo thinke of it: for if they did, they woulde not ſtand againſt vs as they doe. Secondly, if they thought our cauſe to be good, that is, if they thought it to be according vnto Gods word: I demaund of them, whether notwithſtanding the goodnes of our cauſe, they woulde yet thinke vs that labor in the ſame, to be enemies vnto the ſtate or no? Wee make no queſtion but they haue a better opinion of vs. For whatſoeuer they ſaye of the cauſe, they can report no otherwiſe of the favourers thereof, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe that haue alwayes ſhewed themſelues moſt faythfull and truſtie towards their prince and cuntrie. For although within theſe 31. yeres, there haue bin many ſeditious and treaſonable attempts, vndertaken againſt her Majeſtie and the ſtate, by men of all ſortes and degrees: yet by the goodnes of God it cannot be ſhewed, that any one hath had a hande in any of theſe practiſes and conſpiracies, who euer opened his mouth for reformation, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe fauored the ſame. And as for attempting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:22816:8"/>vndutifull or diſloyall action in the promoting of the cauſe it ſelfe: we haue bene ſo farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guiltye in that point,
<note place="margin">D. Bancroft.</note> that one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe &amp; moſt impudent ſlanderers that are amongſt al our aduerſaries (intending of ſet purpoſe to ſtain the cauſe and the fauorers of reformation, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and treaſon) was enforced to paſſe by vs, and to ſuffer the venime of his lying and ſlaunderous tongue to light vpon our brethren in the kingdom of Scotland, which he would neuer haue done, if with any couler he could haue faſtened his ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vntruethes vpon vs the profeſſors of his own cuntrie. So that if we could diſcharge our hands of the cauſe we defend, we doubt not but our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries themſelues would pronounce vs guiltles of all diſloyaltie againſt our prince and cuntrie.</p>
            <p>Seeing then it is cleare, that reformation is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accounted an enemie vnto our ſtate, becauſe it is ſuppoſed to haue no grounde in the worde of God: and ſeeing the fauorers thereof are thought to be turbulent men, not for anye thing that in a good matter they haue ſeditiouſly attempted; but inaſmuch as they labor to promote a cauſe, that of it ſelfe is an enterpriſe daungerous vnto her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties crowne and dignitie: we are for the clearing of the one and the other, to ſee whether the ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors of thoſe, who deſire to haue the Churche of England otherwiſe reformed then hither to it hath bene, be ſuch, as they require nothing in that whol worke, but onely that whiche the worde of God commandeth to be put in execution. The whiche courſe if they be founde to take, then alſo doth it
<pb facs="tcp:22816:9"/>follow, that neither they, nor the cauſe maintained by them, can with any couler be accounted enmity vnto the kingdome wherein they liue.</p>
            <p>And here if I ſhould demaund of the moſt that condemne both vs &amp; the cauſe wherein we ſtand, what that is, which is ſought to be reformed in our Church,
<note place="margin">VVhat equall judges our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries are.</note> I dare be bolde to ſay, that there is not one amongſt ten of them, that knoweth whether it be blacke or white that we would haue. Wherein they do not onely ſhewe themſelues, to weigh the moſt precious and weightie jewell vnder the ſunne with a moſt vn-eauen hande: but alſo (if we beleeue the holy Apoſtle) to claim inheritance in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wages of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes,
<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.12.</note> inaſmuch as they ſpeake euil of thoſe things which they know not. The which courſe if they ſtil holde on, the ſame Apoſtle telleth them, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they ſhall periſh through their owne corruption.</p>
            <p>To the ende then it may appeare what that refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is which we ſeeke for, and which theſe men do account the enemie of our ſtate; it is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
<note place="margin">What we mean by reformation</note> that by reformation we meane nothing els, but the remouing of all thoſe vnlawfull callings which are maintained in our Church and miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, contrarie vnto the reuealed will and written word of the Lord our God, and the reſtoring ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto of all ſuch offices and miniſteries, as the ſame God vnder the paine of his heauie diſpleaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to be planted in his church, when or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hee raiſeth fit men for thoſe functions. To ſpeake more plainly, by reformation we mean, firſt the rooting out of our Church, of al dumb and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching miniſters, all nonreſidents, Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
<pb facs="tcp:22816:9"/>and biſhops, commiſſaries, officials, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, and all the reſt of the wicked offices that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon that vngodly and tyrannous hierarchie of Lord Byſhops, together with their gouernment, and whatſoeuer maim, deformitie or want there is in our Church by meanes of them &amp; their plaees. Secondly, by reformation we meane the placing in euerie congregation within England (as far as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie able men can be provided) of preaching pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Doctors, gouerning elders, &amp; miniſtring Deacons, with whatſoeuer health, comlineſſe and good order, the Lorde by the faythfull labours of theſe officers would haue brought into his church. And theſe are the onely matters that we meane by the reformation of our Church. The which cauſe in both the parts therof, is made ſo juſt and aequall by the word of God, that the promoting of it, can bee accounted the diſturbing of no ſtate that hath not determined with it ſelfe to maintaine the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Sathan and his prerogatiue. For the word of God maketh it out of controuerſie, that neyther the expelling of dumb miniſters &amp; L. Biſhops, &amp;c. out of the Churche, nor the inducing of Paſtors, Doctors. Elders and Deacons into the ſame, can be burdened with any thing contrarie vnto the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of princes and common-wealths, vnleſſe they wil alſo charge the Majeſtie of God with the ſame accuſation. And here we appeale from our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to the word, &amp; are content eyther to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or acquited by the judgment thereof, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon whoſe judgement alſo, they dare not but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues to relie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22816:10"/>
Firſt then we holde it intollerable, that the holy miniſterie of the worde and Sacraments, and the charge of ſoules,
<note place="margin">The deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moouing the dumb miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie no vnduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full attempt.</note> ſhould in our Church be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto ſuch men, as are no more able to teach vs what belongeth to the pure worſhipp of god, then can many a childe of ſixe yeres old. And we would know whether by the worde we may be accounted for this poſition, to bee enemies eyther vnto our moſt deare prince, or vnto our moſt louing cuntry? What doth it determine in this matter, are wee thereby acquited or condemned for this our aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Surely acquited: And that by the voyce of the Sonne of God himſelfe, who openly declareth that the miſerie of that people is vnſpeakably pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, where the
<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 15.14. Iuk. 6.69.</note> blinde leadeth the blinde, who alſo by his owne
<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 9.36. mark. 6.34.</note> example, hath taught vs what compaſſion we ought to haue of our brethren, that are ſcattered as ſheep without a ſheepheard, hauing none to leade them, nor feede them in the way of aeternall life. And therefore is ſo far from diſliking this care of ours towardes the ſaluation of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren &amp; cuntrimen, that he hath enjoyned vs, when we ſee our brethren thicke and threefold to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ditch of blindnes and ignorance, and ſo into the pit of aeternall wo &amp; deſtruction,
<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 9.34.</note> to pray vnto the Lord that he would raiſe vp meet guides, who may leade his people in the true and vpright waye that leadeth vnto life. Before we go any farther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here how the caſe ſtandeth betweene vs and our aduerſaries, and judge vprightly. Our Sauiour Chriſte IESVS teacheth vs to be mooued with pitie and compaſſion, when we ſee the blinde lead
<pb facs="tcp:22816:10"/>the blinde, and our owne fleſhe periſhe for want of the true knowledge of God. We ſee this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſight in our land euery where, &amp; we may heare the blood of ignorant ſoules crie day and night in the eares of the Lorde, for juſte vengeaunce to bee powred vpon their blind leaders, and ſuch as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them. What ſhall we do in this caſe? ſhall we not be touched with any remorſe at all? Farre be it but we ſhould. We are therefore mooued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and as chriſtian duetie bindeth vs: we doe endevor both by our prayers vnto the Lorde, and by our petitions and ſuits vnto our Majeſtrates, and euerye other way that become Chriſtians, to haue theſe murtherers remooued, and to haue thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in their roomes, who bring with them, &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully execute this great and high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the perſon of al true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Now then are we Embaſſadors for Chriſt,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.20.</note> as though God did beſeeche you through vs, we pray you in Chriſtes ſtead, that you be reconciled vnto God. But what ſay the aduerſaries vnto vs, for the performing of ſo neceſſarie a duetie. Verely their cenſure is, that in ſo doing we are enemies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtate. We reply vpon them againe, that the word of God doth cleare vs, of their vnjuſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which doth not ſo much light vpon vs, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the worde and docttine of the ſonne of God. For they that condemne the diſciples of ſedition, for practizing that whiche their maſter enjoyned them, muſt needs paſſe ſentence againſt the maſter, as a teacher of ſeditious doctrine. And therefore we are ſo far from being moued with the vnaequall
<pb facs="tcp:22816:11"/>dealing, that we wiſh them whoſoeuer they be, to giue eare vnto the inditement which the Pſalmiſte frameth againſt them in theſe wordes.
<note place="margin">pſal. 15.19.20.</note> [You haue giuen your mouthes to euill, and with your tongs you forge deceit. You ſit and ſpeake againſt your brethren, and you haue ſlaundered the ſonnes of your mother.

<note place="margin">pſal. 83.3.</note> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they muſt needs confeſſe themſelues guiltie of this accuſation in euery point, therefore we doe alſo aduiſe them, by true and ſpeedie repentaunce to betake them vnto the Lorde, leaſt as it is in the Pſalme [He teare them in pieces, and there be none that can deliuer them.]
<note place="margin">pſal. 50.12</note> And we entreat them that are in authoritie, to weigh the ſtate of the people of this land with the worde of God, and then we doubt not but they ſhall ſee the motion of remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the dumbe miniſtery out of our Church, and the planting of careful teachers, to be the beſt piece of ſeruice one of them, that euer was attempted vnder their gouernment. If to redreſſe the wantes of the pure worſhipp of God, and to remooue the condemnation both of the bodies &amp; the ſoules of men, be thought a ſeruice worthie to be vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For alas, by meanes of the falſe and loytering guides, which haue kept out the true and painfull watche-men, the ſeruice of God hath nowe for the ſpace of 31. yeares, continued at that miſerable ſtay in our kingdom, that in the moſt congregarions, not
<pb facs="tcp:22816:11"/>of miſerable Wales and Ireland onely, but euen of England it ſelf:
<note place="margin">The lamentab'e ſtate of religion in England.</note> we want not ſome neceſſary mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but euen all the vitall partes, as the heart, lyfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood, yea and ſoule of true religion: namely, the word preached, euen the very ſeed, without which men can neyther be begotten vnto, nor nouriſhed in the hope of aeternall bliſſe and happines. Again, by reaſon of this deſolation of our Churche, the moſt of our people within all our prouinces, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering as blinde men in the darke, know no means eyther how to yeeld the Lorde any part of his true worſhipp, or howe they ſhall be ſaued in the day of wrath. Here your Hh. of hir Majeſties priuie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, who profeſſe your ſelues aduerſaries vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and therefore vpholders of our ignorant miniſterie, are cited before the tribunall ſeate of God, and required in his name, to conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie that you offer vnto his Majeſtie, both in the maintenance of theſe blinde guides, &amp; alſo in your proceedings herein; for both which, you are ſure one day to be called to a reckoning. Firſt by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning theſe idoles, you countenance and mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ruines, defectes and profanation of Gods true ſeruice, together with the damnation of mens ſoules. Secondly, your proceedings in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the blooddie cauſe, is ſuche, as vnder the profeſſion of true religion, I thinke the like hath bin ſeldome ſeene. For you thinke it a ſmall matter for you, thus to bereaue the Lorde of his true honor, &amp; to lend your authoritie, might and power vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, to vphold ignorance and blindnes, vnles alſo as a teſtimonie of your perſeuerance in this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:22816:12"/>way, you do account of them that ſeek to bring you into a better courſe, as of the profeſſed enemies of your ſtate. Theſe accuſations I knowe, are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to be laid to the charge of theſe Counſellors, who through Europe haue the name to be furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Gods glory &amp; the ſaluation of mens ſoules: But they are ſuch as if I prooue them not moſt true, let my blood wipe away the ſlaunder which I haue vndutifully rayſed vpon the rulers of my people: Here the worde of God is to be approched vnto, out of the which we are to learne, what true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſeruice they can yeeld vnto God, &amp; what hope of ſaluation they can haue, who neuer enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word preached.</p>
            <p>Concerning the true worſhip of God, we are to knowe, that the worde who alone is to inſtruct vs therein maketh two ſorts thereof.
<note place="margin">The true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or God twofold.</note> The one inward and the other outward. The inwarde worſhip, is the worſhip of the ſpirit, when the heart and the ſoule is by Gods ſpirit ſo directed, that in trueth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie it yeeldeth to the Lord, the worſhip whiche he requireth according vnto his word. Of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaketh vnto the woman of Samariah, Iohn 4.23 24. [The houre commeth ſayth he, and alreadie is, when the true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſhall worſhip the father in ſpirit and trueth, for the father requireth eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch to worſhip him. God is a ſpirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in ſpirit and trueth.]
<note place="margin">the inwarde worſhip.</note> Without this inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it is vnpoſſible to be ſaued, and without it no ſeruice can be acceptable vnto God. But although this inwarde worſhip be the fountaine whence the
<pb facs="tcp:22816:12"/>outward that is in trueth doth flowe and proceed: yet is the inward no otherwiſe ordinarily wrought in men, then by meanes of the outward. So that euen as the outward is neuer truly acceptable vnto God but when it proceedeth from the inwarde, euen ſo is the inward ordinarily found in none, ſaue onely in thoſe wherein it hath bin begotten by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the outward. But this inwarde worſhip in ſpirit and trueth, is not in the power of man to giue or to take away at his pleaſure, but the Lorde muſt and doth worke it, when &amp; where he pleaſeth, yet neuer ordinarily but by meanes of the outward,</p>
            <p>The true outwarde worſhip of God then,
<note place="margin">the outwarde worſhip.</note> is that alone, whereby as by the ordinarie inſtrument or meanes the Lord hath appointed to beget, nouriſh increaſe and continue the inwarde worſhip of the ſoule and the ſpirit, by the which the Lord is to be ſerued in ſpirit and trueth. This outward worſhip is ſuch by the ordinance of God, as men may be truly ſaide, either to hinder or to promote the ſame, and by the hindring or promoting hereof, they may be judged to hinder or promote both the ſaluation of themſelues and others, and alſo the inward worſhip of the ſpirit either in themſelues or in others. And by the affection that men beare herevnto, the Lord doth trie their loue and alſo their hatred towardes him &amp; his glory. This worſhip although it be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yet is it of that nature, as they who are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers hereof, may according vnto the word expect for the preſence of Gods ſpirite, whenſoeuer they approch vnto the Lord therby. Otherwiſe if it hath not this promiſe of the ſpirite annexed vnto it, it is
<pb facs="tcp:22816:13"/>but a rudiment of the world or of the fleſh, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be any thing for the furthering of men in the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>This outwarde worſhip, or this outward meanes to ſerue God truely and ſincerely, conſiſteth of two partes or ordinances, according vnto the twofolde end for the which the Lord hath appointed the ſaid outward worſhip of his. The firſt part hereof, is that ordinance whereby the Lord hath appointed, not only to beget fayth in men, or to engraffe them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, but being engraffed to builde and aedifie them forwarde as liuely ſtones of that holy temple, whereof Chriſt Ieſus is both the head &amp; the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. This ordinance of God, appointed both to beget &amp; to aedifie faith, is onely the word preached The ſecond ordinance wherein the outwarde wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God conſiſteth, is contained in thoſe exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of religion, which the Lord ordained onely for aedification, and were neuer appointed to begett fayth. By aedification I meane whatſoeuer concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our furthering in the worke of our ſaluation, begun in vs through faith by the worde preached. Vnto this ſecond part, we are to refer publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſinging of Pſalmes, reading of the ſcriptures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the ſacraments, and adminiſtring of the Church cenſures,
<note place="margin">Many thinges are ordained to aedifie, which were neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſayth. 1. cor. 14.17. ephef. 4.29.</note> &amp;c. All which are effectuall to ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, but not to the begetting of faith: For that is onely wrought by the word preached, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which alſo, publike prayers, ſinging of pſalmes, &amp;c, are ſo fruſtrated of the end, vz. the aedification, for the whiche the Lorde hath ordained them, as they cannot poſſibly aedifie any aright, ſaue onely
<pb facs="tcp:22816:13"/>theſe who haue learned the right vſe of them by the preaching of the word, &amp; in whoſe hearts faith which is the ground-worke, wherevpon the whole building of gods ſeruice muſt be planted, hath bin begotten by the ſame word ordinarily. And theſe holy ordinances of god, to wit, prayers, receiuing of the Sacraments, are ſo farre from aedifying theſe people, who haue not bene inſtructed in the right vſe of them by the worde preached, that vnto ſuch they are nothing els but a ſealed booke, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from ſuch, they are nothing els but pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Lordes ſight. For no ſeruice can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto god, but that which proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fayth. For without faith it is vnpoſſible to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Now then according vnto that which hitherto hath bene ſpoken, let your Hb. weye what ſeruice your people throughout all hir Majeſties domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the moſt part, can yeald vnto the Lord, and how they ſtand in the hope of ſaiuation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently how carefull you haue bene of the glory of god and the ſaluation of his Church. Your people you will ſay euery where, haue had theſe 31. yeares the vſe of publike prayers, ſinging of Pſalmes, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scriptures in their owne tongue, they haue further enjoyed the ſacraments of baptim &amp; the Lords ſupper. Be it ſo, but what is all this? Can theſe thinges going alone without the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, be any thing effectuall to that worſhip in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and trueth, which is the onely ſeruice that the Lord regardeth, and without which, all exerciſes of true religion are but ſwines-blood before his
<pb facs="tcp:22816:14"/>Majeſtie? Or can they bee anye thing forcible to worke the ſaluation of your people. Queſtionleſſe you ſee that they cannot. For they are ordained of god, not to lay the foandation of the ſpirituall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp, but as meanes to aedifie and build vpon, the foundation being laid. They are ordained you ſee alſo, not to go alone, but to accompany the word, without the which they are fruitles and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Nay though it were poſſible that without the word they could worke ſome aedification in men, yet notwithſtanding they were neuer appointed to beget men into the hope of aeternall life. For rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate fleſh and blood they cannot, becauſe they were onely appointed to edifie thoſe whome the word ſhould beget. So that men may all their life time enjoy theſe exerciſes of true religion, and yet be far from the outward meanes whereby the Lord requireth himſelfe to be worſhipped in ſpirit and trueth, and whereby the ſaluation of their ſoules ſhould be wrought. And though your Honours ſhewe youre ſelues neuer ſo greate fauourers of reading the worde, publike prayers, &amp;c. which in themſelues are acceptable to God; but among our people for the moſt part, abominablie profaned: yet becauſe you maintain thoſe to outcountenance the preaching of the worde, and to be polluted by ſuch men as ought not to deal with the holy things of the Lord: You are no otherwiſe accounted of in his ſight, then the profeſſed enemies of that pure worſhip in ſpirit and trueth (wherein alone he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth) the maintainers of the profanation of his ſeruice, and aduerſaries vnto the ſaluation of his
<pb facs="tcp:22816:14"/>Churche. And what other account I beſeeche you can he make of you, which dare preſume to platte him out the perfection of his ſeruice, and appoint him a way to ſaue his people according vnto your owne pleaſure. He hath ſet down in his word, that without faith it is vnpoſſible to pleaſe him, and ſo that without faith it is vnpoſſible for men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in ſpirit and trueth, and come to aeternall life. In this point I hope you will not gaineſay his Majeſtie. He goeth farther, and manifeſteth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie meanes to beget fayth and ſaluation, to be onely the word preached. And therefore requireth the forwardnes of all thoſe that would not be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of neglecting his honour, to promote the ſaide preaching of his worde. Herein you oppoſe your ſelues vnto him, &amp; reply againe, that he muſt needs prouide himſelfe of newe ordinances, or els he can neither in this life be worſhipped in trueth of your people, nor glorified with their ſaluation in the life to come. For vnleſſe reading of the worde, publike prayers, the profanation of his ſacramentes by the polluted fingers of moſt ignorantmen, can worke all that he requireth, he can haue no meanes in the moſt congregations within the dominions of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to be purely worſhipped, and to gaine himſelf a name, by the ſauing of the diſtreſſed ſouls of men. And you are ſo reſolute with the Lord in this point that you proclaime all them to bee enemies vnto your ſtate, whoſoeuer dare open their mouthes in his cauſe againſt your vnaduiſed reſolutions. So that whatſoeuer fauour your Honors pretend vnto ſome part of the true outward ſeruice of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie:
<pb facs="tcp:22816:15"/>yet inaſmuch as you lende your whole force to maintaine and keepe in the Church, the reading idol miniſterie, which you may know wel inough, can neither beget faith, nor any true aedification in your people, and by whome the Lorde accounteth himſelfe &amp; his ordinances to be profaned: the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trueth is this, that you ſtand at this day guiltie in his ſight, of the defects, ruines and profanations of his worſhip, and alſo of the vtter vndoing of many a thouſand ſoule within England. And I do not ſee what you can alledge for your defence, except you will joyne with that notable ſeducer of your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<note place="margin">D. VVhitgift.</note> the Arch. of Cant. and affirme, eyther that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation may be wrought in your people by hearing the word read, or that reading is preaching. But alas theſe figge leaues, are ſo far from ſtanding you in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtead, when the Lorde ſhall enter into arecko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with our land, for the ſmall care that our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours haue had in furthering his ſeruice, that his wrath will be kindled againſt our ſtate, almoſt for nothing more, then becauſe that both theſe errors of this wicked deceiuer haue beene vncondem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, and alſo as a token I thinke of our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred vnto the Lord and his goſpell, ſuch a detected enemie vnto the goſpell as he is, hath bene promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto one of the higheſt roomes at the counſell table, to the ende, as the maintaining of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings do witneſſe, that he might be a ſcourge vnto Gods Church within hir Majeſties dominions.</p>
            <p>Well, he ſaith that men may be ſaued by hearing the word read, as by the ordinarie meanes. If it be not ſo, wo be to him that euer he was borne, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:22816:15"/>practiſes theſe 20. yeeres almoſt haue tended to no other ende, then to maintaine this damnable error of his. For if men ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſaued by reading, where ſhall he ſtande, which hath brought vpon himſelfe the guiltines of ſo many ſoules, by ſilencing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faythful preachers, and planting readers in their ſtead. And therefore I doe not ſo much blame him for framing his corrupt judgement according vnto the rule of his vngodly practiſes. For if his practiſe were contrarie vnto the light of his knowledge, then hath he a more fearfull account to make, who hath quenched the light of his vnderſtanding to the ende he might with leſſe remorſe, raue againſt the Majeſtie of God. But his blindnes cannot make others inexcuſable, that willingly follow after ſuch a leader, &amp; therefore let vs ſee what the word ſaith vnto this aſſertion.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Paul affirmeth,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.24. Reading not the ordinarie meanes to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> that ſeeing the world by wiſdome knew not god in the wiſdome of god, it pleaſed god by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, to ſaue as many as beleeue: Will you then haue a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that is by fayth whiche you muſt haue, or none at all. Surely the Apoſtle tels you, that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Lorde to worke this no otherwiſe in the hearts of men then by preaching, which vnto the worldly wiſe men is but fooliſhnes, but vnto vs that are ſaued, it is the wiſedome of god, and the power of god. Euen as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we can expect no ſaluation but that which is apprehended by faith, ſo can we not hope to haue this ſauing fayth wrought in vs by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other meanes then by preaching. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſetteth downe in expreſſe wordes, that as many
<pb facs="tcp:22816:16"/>as beleeue,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> are ſaued by the means of preaching. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, how ſhall they call vpon him, ſaith the ſame Apoſtle in another place, in whome they haue not belecued? How ſhal they belieue in him, of whom they haue not heard? Howe ſhall they heare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a preacher. Beholde then, if we will ſo heare as wee may beleeue, the Apoſtle telleth vs that this muſt be the hearing, not of a reader but of a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. If then this ſeducing prelate, cannot make good a ſaluation which is to be obtained without fayth, as heauen and earth knowe he cannot: or if beleuing to ſaluation be conuaied vnto mens ſouls by no other hearing, then by the hearing of a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, as the Apoſtle telleth: then alſo it followeth, to the ſhame and confuſion of all erroneous decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, that he cannot juſtifie a ſaluation wrought in mens heartes by any other ordinarie meanes, then by the word preached. But he will here object, that the Lorde may if it pleaſe him, worke faith in mens hearts without preaching. That is as if he ſhoulde ſay, that the Lord is ſo powerfull, as when man wil not inſtruct by meanes, he can teach his elect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meanes. Who euer denied this? Or what is this to prooue his wicked aſſertion. The queſtion is not what the Lorde can doe, eſpecially where meanes is not to be found. For in ſuch caſes we do not vſe, to tye the omnipotent power of the Lorde, within the bounds, no not of his own ordinances, but the point in controuerſie is, what that way and ordinarie meanes is, whereby the Lorde hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to worke a ſauing faith in the heartes of his people, whether that ordinarie meanes be the word
<pb facs="tcp:22816:16"/>preached, or the word read. The ſpirit of God you ſee teacheth vs, that that ordinarie way and means is preaching. The Archb. of Cant. teacheth it to be reading. Nowe whether of the two, ſhall hir Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties people beleeue? Surely let the Lord be true, &amp; let ſhame &amp; confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> couer the faces of all his enc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp; namely of this wicked prelate, who is not affraid in expreſſe termes, to giue the lye vnto the Majeſty of God. For the which madnes of his, how greate ſoeueuer hee may be in our kingdome, I am ſure that the ſentence, without his vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, is long ſince decreed againſt him, that he
<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 5.19.</note> ſhalbe the leaſt in the kingdome of heauen. And if God had not blinded his right eye, as a token of a farther judgement which is like to fall vpon him, he might haue ſene long ſince, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attributeth the worke of mens regeneration or new birth, and ſo faith and ſaluation vnto the word preached and not read. For ſo he writeth.
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.23.25.</note> Being borneagaine (ſaith the Apoſtle) not of mortall, but of immortall ſeed by the worde of God, which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and endureth for euer, and this is the worde (ſaith he) which is preached among you.</p>
            <p>But what can he ſee, who hath voluntarily ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelfe (and laboreth to wrapp others in the ſame darknes) as he will make men beleeue that he is of judgement, that the meaning of the Apoſtle in ſaying, How can they beleeue without a preacher, is as if hee ſayd, how can they beleeue without a reader? For what els doth he affirme then this, in holding reading to be preaching. For he that auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth reading to be preaching, cannot denie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Reading en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth fayth ſayeth he pag. 570. yea, and ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vavleth more than preaching. pag. 574.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:22816:17"/>to be prechers. And here is al the light which the Lorde hath lefte in that darke vnderſtanding of his, which is juſtly made bruitiſhe, inaſmuch as it hath blinded it ſelfe, to the end (as I ſaid) he might with the leſſe compunction, or gnawing of his con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience fight againſt God. But let him and all his maintainers know from me, that he who ſpared not the Angels, that had ſinned, but caſt them downe into hell, and deliuered them vnto chaines of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to be kept vnto the damnation of the great day, is able to make this bruitiſh man an example vnto all thoſe that hereafter ſhall tread in his vngodly ſteps, eſpeciall ſeeing in theſe things, which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he might know, he (as lude ſayth) hath corrupted himſelfe. For if there had bene no ſcripture to haue inſtructed him, yet very natural reaſon might haue taught him, that reading and preaching are of that diuers nature, that in common reaſon, the one of them cannot be the other. For I pray you, who is ſo ſimple but knoweth by the light of nature, that the preching that carieth ſaluation with it, which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth to be reding, is another maner of work the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be lerned by the induſtrie of man in a moneths labor. And yet behold, ſuch is the preaching which this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath framed vnto vs in his writings, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Church of England ſhould be ſaued, that an vnlettered man comming from the plough, might in one moneths ſtudie be made an able preacher, and ſo an able miniſter of the doctrine of ſaluation. For if reading be preaching (as he ſayth) yea and ſuch a preaching as is able to beget men to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which alſo he affirmeth, then alſo doth it folow,
<pb facs="tcp:22816:17"/>both that an able reader is an able preacher, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that anye man enjoying the benefite of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, may in one moneth, be made an able miniſter of that great and admirable worke of mens ſoules. The conceit wherof, is ſuch an indignitie vnto the Majeſtie of God, and to the miſteries of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a greater cannot be offered. And is this al the thanks, that we in England giue vnto the Lord, for the fruition of his goſpell? Or is this all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation that true religion hath deſerued at our hands? to be made faire baſer then any of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon crafts of the world. Well, the Lord ſeeth this vile injurie offred vnto his goſpell, and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie thereof, and in his time will recompence it. Concerning this abſurde and ſenceleſſe errour, I will ſaye no more at this time: But firſt, that if the father hereof, to wit, the Archb. of Cant, had liued in ſome of the former ages that imbraced the truth, he had bene commended vnto poſteritie, as a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable forger of errors, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the nomber of theſe pernicious hereticks, that haue endeuoured to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the light of the trueth. Secondly, that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the miniſters prayer for the ſpirit of vtterance, and his care in his ſtudie, to be altogether needles &amp; ſuperfluous matters. And ſo this man hath found out ſuche a methodicall kinde of preaching, as the ſpirit of God neuer thought off. The Apoſtle Paul deſireth the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pray for him, that vtterance might be giuen vnto him, to the end he might bold ly open his mouth, to publiſh the ſecrets of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: &amp; he further chargeth Timothie, to take heed vnto learning and to continue therein, for in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:22816:18"/>hee ſhoulde both ſaue himſelfe and thoſe that heard him. But this godleſſe man, that indeede hee might ſhewe himſelfe not vnlike that ſonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, of whoſe bodie and kingdome, by vertue of his Antichriſtian prelacie, he is alſo a limbe and a member, preſumeth to enter into the Lords chaire, and to create newe ordinances for miniſters to bee guided by, in publiſhing the myſteries of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. But though he be like to continue as he is, vz. a deceiuer that waxeth worſe and worſe,
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.14.</note> deceiuing and being deceiued, as the holy ghoſt ſayth: yet it concerneth your Hh. to turne ouer a new leafe, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your conſciences muſt needes tell you, that if you followe his damnable errors, you are alſo to feare leſt you be pertakers of the judgements, that are likely to be faſtened vpon him, and al thoſe that delight to hide the truth in vngodlines. And ſeeing the ſeruice of the Lord, together with the ſaluation of mens ſoules, is by meanes of this dumb miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, at ſuch a miſerable ſtay among vs, (as hath bene ſet downe) it wil be your duties to take theſe things more to hearte then as yet you haue done, and to ſeeke the redreſſe of them.</p>
            <p>For our owne parts, the defectes of Gods religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being thus lamentable in our land, and the ſouls of our brethren with pitifull cries requiring our aid and aſſiſtance, we cannot in conſcience denie them the remedie that we are able to miniſter: namely, the painting out of their miſerie, and the meanes howe to be deliuered therefrom. And aſſuredly, if we ſhould holde our peace and winke at theſe cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, the ſtones in the ſtreate, woulde riſe vp in
<pb facs="tcp:22816:18"/>judgement againſt vs. Wherefore alſo, your Hh. may accuſe vs to be dangerous ſubjects as well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not without chriſtian affections, as for that you ſee vs mooued with pitie at the ruines of Gods houſe, and the likely damnation of our cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen. For ſuch is the opperation of Gods ſpirite in his children, that they are altogether voyd of the aſſuraunce of aeternall life, yea without God in the world, whoſoeuer are not mooued with griefe and ſorow, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſee either the ſeruice of their God, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaluation of thoſe with whom they liue not to be regarded. Vnles then you of hir Majeſties coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, woulde goe about to quenche the motions of Gods ſpirite in the heartes of hir Majeſties people, you cannot charge them with any euill practize a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtate, for laboring the rooting out of this dumb and ignorant miniſterie, whereby as you ſee the Lordes ſeruice is moſt wretchedly profaned, &amp; the ſaluation of his Churche moſt cruelly hindered and withſtood. Nay as your Hh. would ſhew your ſelues to haue anye ſparke of Gods ſpirite in your hearts: ſo you muſt be carefull to joyne with vs in this worke, wherein indeede you ought to be our foreleaders. For otherwiſe (neuer deceue your own hearts) there is not a man of you that can poſſibly be ſaued. Weye the ſpeech my Ll. for it concernes you as much as the price of your ſoules is worth. I ſay then,
<note place="margin">No ſaluation vnto them that are not carefull of the Lords pure worſhip &amp; the ſaluation of their brethren.</note> that the enmitie which in this point wee bear vnto the ſtate of England is ſuch, as vnles you that are of hir Majeſties priuie Counſell joyne with vs in the ſame, you cannot poſſiblie ſee the face of Chriſt to your comforts. The reaſon hereof is, that
<pb facs="tcp:22816:19"/>there is no ſaluation vnto that ſoule, wherein Chriſt Ieſus doth not remaine and dwell by his ſpirit, as the Apoſtle teacheth vs in theſe wordes,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13.5.</note> Prooue your ſelues (ſaith he) whether you are in the fayth, examin your ſelues, know you not that Ieſus chriſt is in you, except you be reprobates. Eyther then a reprobate heart, or an heart poſſeſſing Chriſt Ieſus. Now my Ll. I appeale vnto your conſciences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you thinke that Chriſte can poſſiblie dwell in thoſe heartes, who are not both grieued at the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their brethren, and the miſerable defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the ſeruice of God among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; are with all readie euery way that lieth in them, to preuent the one, and to ſet forwarde the other. What? can Chriſt be there where there is not a deſire, &amp; a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines to labour, that the glorie of God may ſhine vpon earth, by the ſauing of periſhing ſoules, &amp; the ſetting vp of the ſincere honor of the Lorde? Your conſciences I am ſure, muſt needs beare witneſſe to the contrarye. For to denie this, were nothing els, but to make the ſpirite of Chriſte in his children to be pitiles of the wofull eſtate of ſuche ſoules, as for anye thing they knowe, were ordayned to life, and careleſſe in ſeeking the glorye of God, in his pure worſhippe.</p>
            <p>What is the concluſion then, ſurely that youre Hh. muſt either manifeſt yourſelues, to be of their number, for whome the blacknes and terror of the greate daye is prepared, or els you muſt joyne with the reſt of the ſaintes of God within hir Majeſties dominions, not onely in mourning for the wantes of true religion among our people, and the miſery
<pb facs="tcp:22816:19"/>that enſueth thereof, but alſo in labouring moſte earneſtly to finde ſpeedie meanes for the curing of ſo deadlye a wounde. You ſee then howe the caſe ſtandeth betweene the Lord, nay, between your felues, and your owne ſoules. The day will come, when all thoſe whoſe ſinnes are not forgeuen, and iniquities couered by Chriſt Ieſus, ſhall drinke of the deadly wyne of Gods wrath. And you ſee that Chriſt wilbe a couering vnto none, ſaue onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe, in whome he dwelleth by his ſpirit: and more-ouer, that his ſpirit cannot be in them, who are not mooued with the diſhonor of his name, &amp; the deſtruction of men. The Lord warneth you of theſe things, and requyreth of you, that although for the loue of his Majeſtie, and the mercies both outward and inward which hee hath &amp; doth offer to heape vpon you, you cannot bee mooued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his ruinous Church, and wofull people: yet, that you would be ſtyrred forewarde here-vnto by the care which you are to haue of your own ſoules. It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hand of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God. Vengeance is his, and hee will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it. Wherefore as you woulde not drynke of the dreggs of that bitter cup of his indignation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto the world, by the ſpeedy remouing of this dumb miniſtery, and apoynting faithfull tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in their ſtead, that the Lorde hath not in this age placed ouer England, a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell of men that are careleſſe of his glorie, cruell towardes the people committed vnto their charge, and conſequenthe, a counſel of men that are without God in the world, fed with honor and promotion againſt the day of
<pb facs="tcp:22816:20"/>ſlaughter. Men that are ſo far from reſpecting the honour of their God, and the aeternall ſalvation of men, that they are altogether without naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards the good of their owne ſoules. For aſſuredly my Ll. whatſoeuer good opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you may haue of your ſelues, and yourowne proceedings: the Lorde and his Churche both in this age, and alſo among poſterity, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make no other reckoning of you, than of thoſe that liued without the true God in this worlde, as long as you ſhall bee found vpholders of the ignorance which raygneth amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g your people. Where-vpon alſo you ſhall one day by experience finde it to be true, that becauſe the ſauing ſpirite of God neuer came neere your harts, to worke a ſorrow and a mourning therein, for the ſpirituall aniſerie of your brethren &amp; counuiemen: you made no other vſe of your being heere vpon earth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to prouide for your ſelues, an exceeding meaſure of plagues and torments, that may endure vpon you for euer and euer. You ſee it cannot bee otherwiſe: for, to be without compaſſion towardes the miſerable diſperſion of poore ſheep that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der without a guyde, is to be voide of Chriſt Ieſus and his fanctifying ſpirite, vnto the want whereof there is joyned no thing els, but finall damnation both of body and ſoule.</p>
            <p>Wherefore good my Ll. ſuffer the words of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to enter into your ſoules. The Lord is my witnes that I ſpeake not vnto you, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and reuerence due vnto your places. It pityeth me to ſee the caſe wherein ye ſtande before the Lord: for ſurely ye cannot (as I haue ſayd) po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie
<pb facs="tcp:22816:20"/>be ſaued, ſo long as you hold on your courſe in conſenting vnto ignorance and blindnes. There is nothing but judgement merciles vnto thoſe that deferre their turning vnto him. Deceaue not your ſelues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for as I ſhall anſwere before the Lord, in the fearefull day of judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I haue ſet before you the way of life, &amp; the way of death. Chuſe life ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that you may liue, which you ſhall neuer doe, except you do ridde your hands of the defence of this peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t miniſtery, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make vp the breaches of Gods ſanctuarie. Where you ſee, how little beholding ye are vnto thoſe wicked men y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are your Chaplains, who haue neuer made your eſtates knowen vnto you. You may juſtly acconut thoſe vngodly flatterers, to be the greateſt enemies you can haue. For they are guiltie of your blood, &amp; ſerue you almoſte for no other vſe, than to haſten Gods judgements vpon you. But their guilte and puniſhment ſhall not delyuer you in the daye of wrath, for the ſoule that ſinneth ſhall dye the death And therefore nowe that the light is made knowen vnto you, let it not be your condemnation, that
<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn 3.19.</note> light comming among you, yet you loued darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes more than light.</p>
            <p>Well hetherto it appeareth how wrongfullie the fauorers of reformation are charged with enmitye vnto our ſtate, for laboring to haue the dumb mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery rooted out.</p>
            <p>The next bane of our Church are nonre ſidents,
<note place="margin">Non-reſidency.</note> whereof all our Ll. Bb. are guilty: the which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is ſo great, that I do maruel with what face it can be tolerated in a Chriſtian ſtate. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:22816:21"/>I make no queſtion whether the word of God maketh it lawfull for vs to endeuour that no ſuche vilanie be heard off in Iſraell anie more.
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> The dumb Miniſter though intollerable, hath yet ſome colour of his ſinne, becauſe vnder the name of feeding he ſtarueth the poore ſheep. But the bloodie non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident hath no cloake to hyde his vilanie: for he is ſo out of meaſure become impudent in his ſinne, that he dareth make an open profeſſion of murther This ſinne whereof the Papiſtes themſelues haue long ago bene aſhamed, hath ſo kindled the wrath of God againſt our kingdome, that I feare he wilbe no otherwiſe pacified towards vs, than by ſending a ſword through our land, which may reuenge the blood of innocent ſoules, which theſe 31. yeares hath beneſpilt lyke water vpon the earth, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of theſe profeſſed murtherers, and that vnder the profeſſion of the goſpell.</p>
            <p>Though I preach,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.16.</note> ſayeth the bleſſed Apoſtle, I haue nothing to reioyſe of: for neceſſitie is layd vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, yea and wo is vnto me if I preach not the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. This is ſpoken in the perſon of all true mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. But our non-reſidents haue diſpenſed with this neceſſitie, by meanes of their degrees of their Chaplain-ſhipes, and of their faculties. And as for the woe denounced againſt them, they haue a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction at hande wherewith to delude that curſe: which is, that although they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be continuallie reſident at euery one of their charges, yet they are not all the yeare lightlye abſent from all of them. And although they do not continually preache at neyther, yet they are not alwayes idle, but at ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
<pb facs="tcp:22816:21"/>they doe preache, either vpon their owne charges, or els abroad, where occaſion is offered. Now in their abſence they do not prouide ſo euill for their people, but that contrarye to the expreſſe will of the Lord,
<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 44 1.</note> they place others in their ſteade to take the ouerſight of the Sanctuary. And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they are abſent from all their benefices, it is not without ſome reaſonable cauſe: for at all ſuch tymes they attend either in the Courte, in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitye, or are otherwiſe neceſſarilie beſtowed in their private or publick affaires.
<note place="margin">Looke T.C. admo. pag. 28 29</note> And as for the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie that one man ſhould haue manye benefices, it is neceſſary for the encouraging of ſtadents, and the encreaſe of able men to withſtand the common aduerſary. By all which ſpeches of theirs, we ſee to our grief, the words of the holy Apoſtles to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in our wofull tymes, viz.

And when I conſider the great iniury that is offered vnto the Lorde and his Church by meanes of this wicked Hierarchie, and whatſoeuer dependeth therevpon: I cannot but thinke it a ſtrange matter, that the oppugning of ſo intollerable a corruption ſhould bee hardlye thought off, much leſſe accounted vnſufferable in a Chriſtian ſtate. For theſe corruptions of Ll. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, &amp; Biſhops, Commiſſaries, Archdeacons, Chancelors, &amp;c. were altogether vnknowen in the Church of God, vntill the kingdome of Chriſt fell in the ages by paſt to decay, and Sathan in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines thereof, began to laye the foundation, of that monarchie of his, wherein Antichriſte at this daye doth beare rule. That theſe thinges maye bee the better vnderſtood, and that it may be made knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whether the offices of Archb. &amp; Bb. with the reſte of that ſtampe: belong vnto, and had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the kingdome of Chriſte: or els, ſprang vp when Sathan began to lift his hand for the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Antichriſts throne, and ſo appertaine vnto his gouernment: we are to conſider what is meant by the kingdome of Chriſt, in the decay whereof we affirmed theſe offices of Archb. and Bb. to haue had their original &amp; beginning. By the kingdom of Chriſt then generallie taken, we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment and ſuperioritie, which the Lord Ieſus hath aboue all principalities, that are either in heauen or
<pb facs="tcp:22816:24"/>in earth, not ſimplie as hee is the ſecond perſon in trinitie, God aboue all, bleſſed for euermore, but as he is the ſonne manifeſted in the fleſh, Chriſt god and man, and ſo the head of his Church. In reſpect of this regiment of his, the worde of God ſpeaketh of his kingdome 2. maner of wayes: firſt it maketh the ſame to be everlaſting: ſecondlie it conſidereth of it as it is temporarie and to remaine for a tyme. In the former reſpect it cannot poſſible any wayes decay. Of this aeternall kingdome of his the Angell Gabriell ſpake vnto the holye Virgine Marie, after this ſort:

What wil their anſwere be in this point? Surelie they muſte confes, that from the beginning of the new teſtament vnto the latter end of it, there is not a word ſpoken of Ll. Arch b. and Bb. So that whenſoeuer, or by whomeſoeuer they had their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, they haue it not from our Sauiour Chriſte and his word. Becauſe he hath ordained no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his bodie, and no offices of his Kingdome, ſince the written worde of the newe teſtament was penned. Whervpon we muſt needs conclude, that they belong not vnto his kingdome. Naye, wee go further and ſay, that Ll. Archb. and Bb. are ſo farre from hauing their callings warranted by the word, that their verie names, much more their offices, are by the ſame made deteſtable and odious vnto the church, as ſhall preſentlie appeare. As for their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the corruption thereof is ſo great, that they &amp; the puritie of the goſpell together with the liberty of the church, cannot ſtand together.</p>
            <p>Concerning the puritie of the Goſpell, their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings pollute the ſame 2. maner of wayes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe
<pb facs="tcp:22816:26"/>the libertie of the church by as many. Firſte they will bee Miniſters, and civill magiſtrates too, that is, they wilbee miniſters of the kingdome of Chriſt, and the kingdome of the world all at once. Whereby they declare vnto vs, that they thinke it not ſufficient to bee as their
<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 10.24.25. Iohn 18.36.</note> maiſter was, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his king dome not to be of this worlde: that is, that he was not manifeſted in the fleſh, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle with the execution of civill functions: but to be ruler of a kingdome, that conſiſteth in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of gouernment and dominion than the kingdomes of the world doe. Whoſe example in this point, all his true miniſters muſte needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, vnleſſe they will make a ſhamefull defection from their maiſter, vnto whome (being heere vpon earth) though he were the lord of all his creatures, it had bene vnlawfull, to haue taken vpon him the function of the civill magiſtrate. And therefore we reade that when the multitude woulde haue made him king,
<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.15.</note> he withdrew himſelf out of the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that hee was not ſent hyther to deale in anye thing, but in the worke of mans redemption: and ſo if as a Magiſtrate hee had intermedled with the diſpenſation of civill things, be had not contained himſelf within the limites of that calling, wherevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he was anointed with the oyle of gladnes aboue his fellowes. Not that the calling of the Magiſtrate being Gods ordinanceis a thing vnlawful in it ſelf, but that the Lord hath ſo apointed, that hee which is to be the miniſter of the glad tidinges of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, cannot be the miniſter of ciuill juſtice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. By reaſon that theſe two ordinances of the
<pb facs="tcp:22816:26"/>magiſtracie &amp; miniſterie, though proceeding both of them from the Lord, do yet flow from him in a diuerſe conſideration and reſpecte. For the ciuill magiſtrate is the Lords liuetennant and meſſenger, in reſpect that the Lord is gouernor and ruler of all his creatures, and eſpeciallie of men: and therefore hath apointed the civill magiſtracie, to keepe them in that outward obedience, which he requireth at their handes. Now the miniſter is the Lordes meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger in an other regarde. viz. In reſpecte that the Lord offereth peace and reconciliation vnto men, if they
<note n="*" place="margin">2. Theſ. 1.9.</note> beleeue and obeye his goſpell. Vnleſſe therefore we would make the Lord, to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of mankinde, in that reſpect that hee is the Creator and the gouernor thereof, &amp; ſo confound thedecree of the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the creatures, with the decree and ordinance of mans redemption, we cannot without the breach of the Lords holy will, confound theſe two callings together. And ſurelie by how much the work of mans redemption from the aeternall wrath of God, is more excellent, than the worke of the creation and government of the creatures: by ſo much the more deteſtable and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious doe they manifeſt themſelues: who being as they would be accounted miniſters of that reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation made betweene God &amp; man, do either vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reiect their miniſtery, becauſe they think it to baſe, and gainleſſe a calling: or els as a farther cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vnto the moſt glorious vocation vnder the funne, doe adde the ciuill magiſtracie there-vnto. Whereby they ſhewe themſelues indeede to haue made a ſhamefull apoſtacie from the doctrine and
<pb facs="tcp:22816:27"/>practiſe of our ſauiour Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The weapons of whoſe warfare were not carnall,

And no farther I ſay, becauſe the word [kurios] in the greeke tongue, (as alſo the word

In which ſence it is not forbidden vnto mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to be called [kurioi.] Which I adde to ſtoppe theynlearned and fooliſh cavils of our aduerſaries, who go about to proue it as lawful for our biſhops to be called lords in the Engliſh tongue, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes are names of worldly honor and promotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in our common ſpeach, as it were for them, to haue the former greek, hebrue, &amp; latine names, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them. Whiche by the places before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; to any man of vnderſtanding in the tongues appeareth to bee a cavill vnworthie the aunſwere. And that our Sauiour Chriſte forbidding his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to [kurieuein] viz, to rule lyke lordes, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb facs="tcp:22816:28"/>them alſo to be called Lords, it is moſt cleare in that otherwayes he ſhould open a wide dore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ambition and pryde, of proude and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men. For it is a farre greater token of pride and ambition for a man who cannot by any right haue the dignitye of a lorde, to deſire the name and title thereof: than for him to be ſo called that is a Lord indeed. So that in forbidding his diſciples to (ku<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieuein) beare rule as the lords of the nations doe, he forbiddeth them alſo to bee called and tearmed by their titles. I know what hath beene obiected by the Archb. vnto theſe thinges, and will againe bee ſaid, if it be not prevented: namely, that our Sauior forbiddeth tyrannous lordſhip and tyrannous bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of rule in the former place, &amp; not juſt, vpright, and lawfull government. Where I beſeech your Hh. to lend me your attention, &amp; you ſhall ſee the intollerable boldnes of this man in peruerting the truth, who is not aſhamed (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer it may be for his behoofe) to teach points of doctrine meere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the words &amp; mind of the Lord Ieſus. I demand then of him, whether our Sauiour Chriſt did not in the place afore cited, ſo aunſwere his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples in the pointe whereof they doubted, as hee did fullie reſolue them? He dares not deny it I am ſure. For in pointes that are needfull to be knowen &amp; reuealed, our Sauiour being dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded one thing doeth not frame his anſwere vnto that whereof no queſtion is made, and ſo leaue his church vnſarisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What was the queſtion then? Was it whether any of them ſhould rule lyke a tyrant? was it whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of them ſhould gape after promotion? no
<pb facs="tcp:22816:29"/>ſuch thing. For they knew well enough, that it was very gainleſſe for them to demaund of our ſauiour which of them ſhould be a tyrant? which of them ſhould abuſe his lawfull ſuperioritie, or whiche of them ſhould be an ambitious prelate? they knewe well enough that he would allow no ſuch dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and preheminence. Beſides, the apoſtles (we may well think,) were not ſo blinde, as to demand any ſuch queſtion of their maiſter. Nowe then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding no ſuch thing at his handes, to what end ſhould he tell them, that they ſhould not be tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous rulers? They made no queſtion of any ſuche matter, &amp; therefore a reſolution of that which they called not into controuerſye, was nothing to the purpoſe, but left them as doubtful as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Wherefore wee are to conclude, that as the queſtion was concerning lawfull preheminence &amp; bearing of rule, his negatiue anſwere being frained vnto their queſtion, denieth vnto them, not only a tyrannous and an ambitious prelacie, wherof they made no queſtion, but euen that dominion &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence which of it ſelf is lawfull in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who by the ordinance of God are capable of it: to wit, in the civill magiſtrate. And whereas the Apoſtles dreaming of a worldly kingdom, might alledge for themſelues, that their demand was not altogether without ground, becauſe they contended for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperioritie then was allowed off, in the rulers of worldlie kingdomes: our maiſter Chriſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that obiection, and telleth them, that although it bee lawfull for ciuill gouernours to beare rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their fellow officers and collegues, that is, ouer
<pb facs="tcp:22816:29"/>ciuill magiſtrates, and althoughe it bee lawfull for them to beare lordlie rule and authoritie, and to haue highe ſtiles and titles, yet among you that are Miniſters of the Goſpell, it ſhall not bee ſo ſaieth he. And to perſwade them herevnto,
<note place="margin">Luk. 22.27.28</note> he bringeth in his owne example, who came to ſerue and not to beare rule in the miniſtery of the new teſtament. Making it alſo knowne vnto them, and to all his true miniſters, that although they were according vnto his example to ſerue, and not to exerciſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion all the time of their being vpon earth in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the goſpell,
<note place="margin">Verſe 29.30.</note> yet there was a kingdome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them wherein they ſhould haue an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall preheminence. But as for anie dominion here vpon earth, if they would be his true diſciples, they were to look for none, but to be as he was, and to take the Miniſterye vpon them on the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that hee did. viz. to ſerue and not to beare rule therein.</p>
            <p>Of all theſe things then wee doe conclude, that this threefold corruption of our Archb. and Bb. Firſt, in vſurping vpon the government of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill magiſtrate: ſecondlie, in claming vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thoſe highe names and titles, which belong vnto worldly honors and promotions: laſtly in the lordlie preheminence and ſuperioritie, which they vſurpe ouer the whole body of the Church, within their dioceſe in generall, and ouer their fellow mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in particular, is altogether a matter to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted of all true chriſtians, as abhominable and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in the preſence of the Lorde. And ſeeing our head Chriſt Ieſus granteth vnto his body this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb facs="tcp:22816:30"/>that al the members thereof ſhould be ſervants and not lordes therein, (as he himſelf did ſerue &amp; not beare rule in the kingdome of the goſpell) and hath giuen all true miniſters this priuiledge, that none of them ſhoulde rule ouer the other, it muſte needs be that this lordlyke gouernment which our biſhops arrogate vnto themſelues ouer the church of God and the Miniſters of it, cannot in it ſelfe, though it were never abuſed, but bee preiudiciall vnto the liberties of the church, and the miniſters thereof.</p>
            <p>Therefore my Ll. maintaine the Hierarchy of Bb. as long as you will, you vpholde thereby nothing els, but the tyranny and bondage of the church, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a chiefe and an eſpeciall portion of the kingdome of Antichriſt. For as this peſtilent Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy hath bene proued, not to appertain vnto the kingdome of Chriſt: ſo your Hh. are to know, that the ſame belongeth vnto no other body, then vnto that regiment whereof the ſonne of perdition is the head. For vnto the kingdome of Chriſt as you ſee, it doth not belong, to the kingdome of the world, that is, vnto the civill magiſtracie it cannot apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, for it would bee accounted an eccleſiaſticall conſtitution, and not any civill regiment. To Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometiſme, or to any other heathniſh Idolatry, it cannot belong, becauſe it is onely retained among thoſe that pretend the name of Chriſt, and are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the true churche in deede, or at the leaſte doe wrongfully retaine the name of the true churche. Now vnto the true church it doeth not belong, as we haue already proued, becauſe it is a government
<pb facs="tcp:22816:30"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting of thoſe offices, which the head neuer or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be in the bodie, and conſiſteth of ſuche members, as would beare rule and not ſerue in the miniſterie of the Goſpel. We muſt then place them in deede where of right they ought to be, that is in the falſe ſinagogue, which vniuſtly arrogateth vnto it ſelfe, the name of the true churche of God, and that is in the kingdome of Antichriſte, the Pope: Whoſe kingdome muſt begin in the church of god and not among the heathen, as it was expreſly fore tolde by the apoſtle Paule.
<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.5.</note> Sathan therefore being to lay the foundation of this antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kingdome within the churche and temple of God, that hee might with more colour afterwardes pretend the name of the churche, began by little and little to poiſon the miniſters of the goſpell with worldlye promotion and ſuperiority, and ſo from ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings brought the Hierarchye vnto that height of pryde wherein wee ſee it at this day, not only in his own kingdom where he ruleth by his vicaz the Pope, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among vs in the perſons of our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Prelates. And although Sathan was enforced to watche a long time, for his opportunity, ere he could bring the miniſters of the goſpell vnto lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip &amp; dominion,
<note place="margin">A bout the year 320.</note> (for vnto the time of Pope Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter Rome it ſelf was without any lordſhip atal) yet notwithſtanding he was driuen to work that in the Church, before ever he could aduance the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſin vnto the chaire of iniquity. So that by means of this ſuperioritye and worldlye dominion of the miniſters of the word, he began at the firſt to make the waye for the in bringing of the my ſterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
<pb facs="tcp:22816:31"/>which as the holy ghoſt teſtifieth,
<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.7.</note> began to manifeſt it ſelf in the age of the apoſtles. And go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on forwarde by degrees, he ſo ſtrengthened theſe plants of his owne graffing, that he made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee the inſtrnmentes by the ſtrength and power whereof, he convaied the whole bodie (whereof they were the members) head and al, into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. For in theſe wicked offices of Archb. and Ll.Bb. the man of ſinne firſt began to manifeſt him ſelf,
<note place="margin">Cardinals were brought into the Romiſh church, ſince it fel cleane away from Chriſt, &amp; they are rather the pomp then the ſtrength of that kingdome.</note> &amp; now he is eſpecially vpheld through no other power, but through their meanes, by whom alſo the whole kingdome of Idolatrie and darknes vnder him is eſpecially gouerned.

            <p>But wee are not to think that Sathan, by whome theſe offices of Archbiſhops and L. Biſhops, were firſte invented, doeth at all tymes and places vſe them to the one and ſelfe ſame purpoſe, hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth full well, that hee cannot alwayes effecte what
<pb facs="tcp:22816:31"/>he would do with them, and therefore hee is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, vntill conveniencye bee offered, to beſtowe them as he may. But alwayes this is a ground, hee hath ſome ſeruice for them in all ages. At the firſte planting of them, and long after that, hee did not vohold open Idolatry, and manifeſt apoſtacy from Chriſt by their meanes, hee coulde not doe it, the times woulde not ſuffer him, who thoughe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes very corrupt, were yet far from that vile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God. Example heereof you may ſee in Pope Gregory the firſt of that name,

For he vſed their places, as ſteps and degrees to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Antichriſt into his throne. Now in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the man of ſinne, ſince Rome became the cage of euery vncleane beaſt, and the verye recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of Diuels, he hath the Hierarchy at his owne commandement, to accompliſh his owne will by it vnto the full.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he worketh by theſe Antichriſtian offices very mightely as we ſee, in ſtaying the courſe of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the eſtabliſhing of the kingdome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: though not by meanes of anye publick Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yet by the maintenance of ignorance &amp; blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and by the oppreſſion of the church. </p>

And in earth, not ſimplie as hee is the ſecond perſon in trinitie, God aboue all, bleſſed for euermore, but as he is the ſonne manifeſted in the fleſh, Chriſt god and man, and ſo the head of his Church. In reſpect of this regiment of his, the worde of God ſpeaketh of his kingdome 2. maner of wayes: firſt it maketh the ſame to be everlaſting: ſecondlie it conſidereth of it as it is temporarie and to remaine for a tyme. In the former reſpect it cannot poſſible any wayes decay. Of this aeternall kingdome of his the Angell Gabriell ſpake vnto the holye Virgine Marie, after this ſort:

Not that the calling of the Magiſtrate being Gods ordinance is a thing vnlawful in itſelf, but that the Lord hath ſo apointed, that hee which is to be the miniſter of the glad tidinges of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, cannot be the miniſter of ciuill juſtice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. By reaſon that theſe two ordinances of the
<pb facs="tcp:22816:34"/>magiſtracie &amp; miniſterie, though proceeding both of them from the Lord, do yet flow from him in a diuerſe conſideration and reſpecte. For the ciuill magiſtrate is the Lords liuetennant and meſſenger, in reſpect that the Lord is gouernor and ruler of all his creatures, and eſpeciallie of men: and therefore hath apointed the civill magiſtracie, to keepe them in that outward obedience, which he requjreth at their handes. Now the miniſter is the Lordes meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger in an other regarde. viz. In reſpecte that the Lord offereth peace and reconciliation vnto men, if they
<note n="*" place="margin">2. Theſ. 1.9.</note> beleeue and obeye his goſpell. Vnleſſe therefore we would make the Lord, to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of mankinde, in that reſpect that hee is the Creator and the gouernor thereof, &amp; ſo confound the decree of the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the creatures, with the decree and ordinance of mans redemption, we cannot without the breach of the Lords holy will, confound theſe two callings together. And ſurelie by how much the work of mans redemption from the aeternall wrath of God, is more excellent, than the worke of the creation and government of the creatures: by ſo much the more deteſtable and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious doe they manifeſt themſelues: who being as they would be accounted miniſters of that reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation made betweene God &amp; man, do either vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reiect their miniſtery, becauſe they think it to baſe, and gainleſſe a calling: or els as a farther cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vnto the moſt glorious vocation vnder the ſunne, dee adde the ciuill magiſtracie there-vnto. Whereby they ſhewe themſelues indeede to haue made a ſhamefull apoſtacie from the doctrine and
<pb facs="tcp:22816:35"/>practiſe of our ſauiour Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The weapons of whoſe warfare were not carnall,

Heere are the onely weapons that our Sauiour Chriſt and his Apoſtles vſed, and the onely weapons that are graunted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to miniſters, to ouerthrow the gayn-ſayer. And as for the civill puniſhment of the obſtinat, they muſt commit that vnto the magiſtrate, who beareth not the ſworde in vaine.
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.3.4.</note> For it is he and not the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the word, whome the Lord hath appointed to take reuenge of him that doth euill.

In which ſence it is not forbidden vnto mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to be called [kurioi.] Which I adde to ſtoppe the vnlearned and fooliſh cavils of our aduerſaries, who go about to proue it as lawful for our biſhops to be called lords in the Engliſh tongue, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes are names of worldly honor and promotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in our common ſpeach, as it were for them, to haue the former greek, hebrue, &amp; latine names, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them. Whiche by the places before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; to any man of vnderſtanding in the tongues appeareth to bee a cavill vnworthie the aunſwere. And that our Sauiour Chriſte forbidding his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to [kurieuein] viz, to rule lyke lordes, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb facs="tcp:22816:36"/>them alſo to be called Lords, it is moſt cleare in that otherwayes he ſhould open a wide dore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ambition and pryde, of proude and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men. For it is a farre greater token of pride and ambition for a man who cannot by any right haue the dignitye of a lorde, to deſire the name and title thereof: than for him to be ſo called that is a Lord indeed. So that in forbidding his diſciples to (ku<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieuein) beare rule as the lords of the nations doe, he forbiddeth them alſo to bee called and tearmed by their titles. I know what hath beene obiected by the Archb. vnto theſe thinges, and will againe bee ſaid, if it be not prevented: namely, that our Sauior forbiddeth tyrannous lordſhip and tyrannous bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of rule in the former place, &amp; not juſt, vpright, and lawfull government. Where I beſeech your Hh to lend me your attention, &amp; you ſhall ſee the intollerable boldnes of this man in peruerting the truth, who is not aſhamed (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer it may be for his behoofe) to teach points of doctrine meere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the words &amp; mind of the Lord Ieſus. I demand then of him, whether our Sauiour Chriſt did not in the place afore cited, ſo aunſwere his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples in the pointe whereof they doubted, as hee did fullie reſolue them? He dares not deny it I am ſure. For in pointes that are needfull to be knowen &amp; reuealed, our Sauiour being dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded one thing doeth not frame his anſwere vnto that whereof no queſtion is made, and ſo leaue his church vnſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What was the queſtion then? Was it whether any of them ſhould rule lyke a tyrant? was it whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of them ſhould gape after promotion? no
<pb facs="tcp:22816:37"/>ſuch thing. For they knew well enough, that it was very gainleſſe for them to demaund of our ſauiour which of them ſhould be a tyrant? which of them ſhould abuſe his lawfull ſuperioritie, or whiche of them ſhould be an ambitious prelate? they knewe well enough that he would allow no ſuch dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and preheminence. Beſides, the apoſtles (we may well think,) were not ſo blinde, as to demand any ſuch queſtion of their maiſter. Nowe then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding no ſuch thing at his handes, to what end ſhould he tell them, that they ſhould not be tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous rulers? They made no queſtion of any ſuche matter, &amp; therefore a reſolution of that which they called not into controuerſye, was nothing to the purpoſe, but left them as doubtful as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Wherefore wee are to conclude, that as the queſtion was concerning lawfull preheminence &amp; bearing of rule, his negatiue anſwere being frained vnto their queſtion, denieth vnto them, not only a tyrannous and an ambitious prelacie, wherof they made no queſtion, but euen that dominion &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence which of it ſelf is lawfull in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who by the ordinance of God are capable of it: to wit, in the civill magiſtrate. And whereas the Apoſtles dreaming of a worldly kingdom, might alledge for themſelues, that their demand was not altogether without ground, becauſe they contended for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperioritie then was allowed off, in the rulers of worldlie kingdomes: our maiſter Chriſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that obiection, and telleth them, that although it bee lawfull for ciuill gouernours to beare rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their fellow officers and collegues, that is, ouer
<pb facs="tcp:22816:37"/>ciuill magiſtrates, and althoughe it bee lawfull for them to beare lordlie rule and authoritie, and to haue highe ſtiles and titles, yet among you that are Miniſters of the Goſpell, it ſhall not bee ſo ſaieth he. And to perſwade them herevnto,
<note place="margin">Luk. 22.27.28</note> he bringeth in his owne example, who came to ſerue and not to beare rule in the miniſtery of the new teſtament. Making it alſo knowne vnto them, and to all his true miniſters, that although they were according vnto his example to ſerue, and not to exerciſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion all the time of their being vpon earth in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the goſpell,
<note place="margin">Verſe 29.30.</note> yet there was a kingdome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them wherein they ſhould haue an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall preheminence. But as for anie dominion here vpon earth, if they would be his true diſciples, they were to look for none, but to be as he was, and to take the Miniſterye vpon them on the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that hee did. viz. to ſerue and not to beare rule therein.</p>
            <p>Of all theſe things then wee doe conclude, that this threefold corruption of our Archb. and Bb. Firſt, in vſurping vpon the government of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill magiſtrate: ſecondlie, in claiming vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thoſe highe names and titles, which belong vnto worldly honors and promotions: laſtly in the lordlie preheminence and ſuperioritie, which they vſurpe ouer the whole body of the Church, within their dioceſe in generall, and ouer their fellow mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in particular, is altogether a matter to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted of all true chriſtians, as abhominable and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in the preſence of the Lorde. And ſeeing our head Chriſt Ieſus granteth vnto his body this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb facs="tcp:22816:38"/>that al the members thereof ſhould be ſervants and not lordes therein, (as he himſelf did ſerue &amp; not beare rule in the kingdome of the goſpell) and hath giuen all true miniſters this priuiledge, that none of them ſhoulde rule ouer the other, it muſte needs be that this lordlyke gouernment which our biſhops arrogate vnto themſelues ouer the church of God and the Miniſters of it, cannot in it ſelfe, though it were never abuſed, but bee preiudiciall vnto the liberties of the church, and the miniſters thereof.</p>
            <p>Therefore my Ll. maintaine the Hierarchy of Bb. as long as you will, you vpholde thereby nothing els, but the tyranny and bondage of the church, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a chiefe and an eſpeciall portion of the kingdome of Antichriſt. For as this peſtilent Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy hath bene proued, not to appertain vnto the kingdome of Chriſt: ſo your Hh. are to know, that the ſame belongeth vnto no other body, then vnto that regiment whereof the ſonne of perdition is the head. For vnto the kingdome of Chriſt as you ſee, it doth not belong, to the kingdome of the world, that is, vnto the civill magiſtracie it cannot apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, for it would bee accounted an eccleſiaſticall conſtitution, and not any civill regiment. To Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometiſme, or to any other heathniſh Idolatry, it cannot belong, becauſe it is onely retained among thoſe that pretend the name of Chriſt, and are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the true churche in deede, or at the leaſte doe wrongfully retaine the name of the true churche. Now vnto the true church it doeth not belong, as we haue already proued, becauſe it is a government
<pb facs="tcp:22816:38"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting of thoſe offices, which the head neuer or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be in the bodie, and conſiſteth of ſuche members, as would beare rule and not ſerue in the miniſterie of the Goſpel. We muſt then place them in deede where of right they ought to be, that is in the falſe ſinagogue, which vniuſtly arrogateth vnto it ſelfe, the name of the true churche of God, and that is in the kingdome of Antichriſte, the Pope: Whoſe kingdome muſt begin in the church of god and not among the heathen, as it was expreſly fore tolde by the apoſtle Paule.
<note place="margin">2.

And although Sathan was enforced to watche a long time, for his opportunity, ere he could bring the miniſters of the goſpell vnto lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip &amp; dominion,
<note place="margin">About the year 320.</note> (for vnto the time of Pope Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter Rome it ſelf was without any lordſhip at al) yet notwithſtanding he was driuen to work that in the Church, before ever he could aduance the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſin vnto the chaire of iniquity. So that by means of this ſuperioritye and worldlye dominion of the miniſters of the word, he began at the firſt to make the waye for the in bringing of the my ſterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie:
<pb facs="tcp:22816:39"/>which as the holy ghoſt teſtifieth,
<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.7.</note> began to manifeſt it ſelf in the age of the apoſtles. And go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on forwarde by degrees, he ſo ſtrengthened theſe plants of his owne graffing, that he made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee the inſtrnmentes by the ſtrength and power whereof, he convaied the whole bodie (whereof they were the members) head and al, into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. For in theſe wicked offices of Archb. and Ll. Bb. the man of ſinne firſt began to manifeſt him ſelf,
<note place="margin">Cardinals were brought into the Romiſh church, ſince it fel cleane away from Chriſt, &amp; they are rather the pomp then the ſtrength of that kingdome.</note> &amp; now he is eſpecially vpheld through no other power, but through their meanes, by whom alſo the whole kingdome of Idolatrie and darknes vnder him is eſpecially gouerned. For the inwarde parts of that kingdome, to wit, the peſtilent errors whereby he poyſoneth the world, would eaſily wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and decay, were it not that they are foſtered &amp; nouriſhed by theſe ruling members of Archb. &amp; Bb Who although when they were firſt brought into the church (being therein ordained for good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes as fleſh &amp; bloud did imagine) they were not nor could not be diſcerned to bee members of the Antichriſtian kingdome, becauſe that myſtery was not then made fully viſible, yet euer ſince that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hath appeared, we know them to bee members thereof in ſuch ſort, as whereſoever they are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, there the limbs and members of Antichriſt are countenanced and vpheld.</p>
            <p>But wee are not to think that Sathan, by whome theſe offices of Archbiſhops and L. Biſhops, were firſte invented, doeth at all tymes and places vſe them to the one and ſelfe ſame purpoſe, hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth full well, that hee cannot alwayes effecte what
<pb facs="tcp:22816:39"/>he would do with them, and therefore hee is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, vntill conveniencye bee offered, to beſtowe them as he may. But alwayes this is a ground, hee hath ſome ſeruice for them in all ages. At the firſte planting of them, and long after that, hee did not vohold open Idolatry, and manifeſt apoſtacy from Chriſt by their meanes, hee coulde not doe it, the times woulde not ſuffer him, who thoughe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes very corrupt, were yet far from that vile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God. Example heereof you may ſee in Pope Gregory the firſt of that name,
<note place="margin">Anno 604.</note> and eſpecially in all his predeceſſors, whoſe ſuperioritye and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion hee could not ſo haue at commandement, as he had the prelacy of all thoſe that followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him vnto this day. And yet had he his turnes to bring to paſſe by their ſuperiority, though the moſt of them were vndoubtedly Gods deare children. For he vſed their places, as ſteps and degrees to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Antichriſt into his throne. Now in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the man of ſinne, ſince Rome became the cage of euery vncleane beaſt, and the verye recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of Diuels, he hath the Hierarchy at his owne commandement, to accompliſh his owne will by it vnto the full. So can hee not haue it in England at this day. The time will not ſuffer it, her Maieſty and our ſtate will not beare it, and yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he worketh by theſe Antichriſtian offices very mightely as we ſee, in ſtaying the courſe of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the eſtabliſhing of the kingdome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: though not by meanes of anye publick Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yet by the maintenance of ignorance &amp; blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and by the oppreſſion of the church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22816:40"/>
And they are greatlye deceaued who thinke the members of the Antichriſtian kingdome to ſerue the Diuell in no ſteade, when they are not joyned with their head, and when he maintayneth not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen warres againſt Chriſt Ieſus by their meanes: It is far otherwiſe. For hee knoweth even vnder the profeſſion of the goſpell, howe to employ them to his ſingular advantage, as well as in the kingdome of the Pope, and euen to the ſame purpoſes verye ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For we know that the ſway which he beareth in Babilon it ſelfe, by Archb. and Ll. Bb. conſiſts not onely in maintayning the open impicties, I do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry &amp; errors which are there held, but a great part of his working power in them, ſheweth it ſelfe, in ſuppreſſing the truth, and in the tyrannous vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of thoſe poore ſoules in miſerable darckneſſe, who would gladly bee at the light, were it not that they are kept in bondage and ſlauery, by meanes of his foreſaide inſtruments. The lyke vſe hath he for Archb. and Ll. Bb. in England at this daye. Where hee defendeth errors, maintaineth ignorance, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the truth, and oppreſſeth the church, yea &amp; perſecuteth the Saintes of God to the loſſe of their goods, and their libertie, and euen vnto the blood by their power. And if he cannot as yet tread down the ciuil magiſtrate and erect open Idolatry by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is becauſe his time is not yet come. For as I ſaid, hir Maieſty and our ſtate can brook no ſuch thing. And I doe thinke that the men who exerciſe theſe Antichriſtian offices amongſt vs, would be hardly gotten to afforde him their help in theſe caſes. But when her Maieſty (whoſe lyfe the Lorde continue
<pb facs="tcp:22816:40"/>vnto his glory, the good of his church, &amp; hir owne comfort) is gone the way of all the world, &amp; when our eſtate is ſome-thing more infected with popery then as yet it is, and ſo the favorers of that Idolatry are crept into the ſeates of Archb. and Bb. ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe members will not deſire to bee joyned with their head? It cannot bee otherwiſe. For the Diuell by whom they were firſt inſtituted hath this purpoſe in retayning them in the true church: that by their meanes when he findeth his opportunity he may, either bring the church, ouer whom they rule, from the obedience of Chriſt Ieſus, vnto the bondage and ſlauery of Antichriſte, or els murther thoſe that will not yeeld vnto that Idoll.
<note place="margin">Compare them together.</note> Hee hath alwayes held this courſe. King Edward &amp; Quene Maries dayes do teſtifie this vnto vs. And wee may well thinke, that as when theſe members were firſt pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in the church, (though the Archb. of Rome himſelf a long time maintained true religion in far better ſtate, than the Archb. of Cant. doeth nowe) they never ceaſed vntill they were joined with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt their head, and had caried the true churche captiue with them vnto the ſame abhomination: ſo now being cut off from their heade, they will not be quiet vntill againe they bee engraffed into their proper and naturall bodie.</p>
            <p>Now that they are the members of that body &amp; not of the kingdome of Chriſt beſides all that hath bene ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this reaſon may ſerue in ſtead of many. Namely, that Sathan never thinketh himſelfe to haue fully erected Popery, vntill ſuch time as hee hath eſtabliſhed the Hierarchye of Lorde Biſhops.
<pb facs="tcp:22816:41"/>For whereas popery conſiſts of 2. eſpecially pointes, viz. the falſe religion, and the falſe government of that ſinagogue, neither of thoſe partes can be away where that kingdome is compleat &amp; abſolute.</p>
            <p>Entertaine the falſe religion of the pope, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the receauing of the hierarchie, ye do not fullye yeeld vnto popery, &amp; ſubmit your ſelues fully vnto the Antichriſtian kingdom. On the other ſide, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the religion of Chriſt, together with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by paſtors, doctors, elders, &amp; deacons, which he hath appointed in his word, and you do fullye entertaine whatſoever belongeth vnto the kingdome of the goſpell, though you neuer know what the hierarchy of Bb. doth mean: which could not bee true, if the hierarchye belonged vnto that kingdome of Chriſt. Seing then that the kingdome of Chriſt, and true religion may be abſolute &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, though the offices of Ll. Archb. and Bb. bee not joined therevnto: and ſeeing that where theſe are not retayned, ſome part of Popery is wanting: it followeth that L. Archb. and Bb. doe appertaine vnto the regiment of the beaſt and his Idolatrie, &amp; not vnto the religion and kingdome of Chriſt. The conſequence whereof is, that they who labour and ſtriue for the maintenance of thoſe coruptions in our church, labour and ſtriue for the vpholding of a part of the kingdome of Antichriſt the pope. The continuance of whoſe members amongeſt vs, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to no other purpoſe, then to keepe poſſeſſion, vntill the head hath gotten him ſufficient force, to invade both the true churche of God, and the throne of the civill Magiſtrate in our kingdome.
<pb facs="tcp:22816:41"/>And ſurely if this Hierarchy, vnder whoſe winges Popery hath growne ſo faſt within theſe 20 yeares, doth ſtande anye long time in England, I looke for no other effect to come from it but theſe two. Firſt a toleration for men to profeſſe popiſh Idolatry.
<note place="margin">Tolleration of Popery.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, vpon the grant heereof, I look that by little &amp; little the ſtate of her Maieſties crown (which the Lord forbid,) ſhould be brought in bondage vnder the Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authority of the pope. If you grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the former, the latter muſt needs follow. For let it once be ſene that popery hath gotten ſuch ſtrength among vs, that after 31. yeares baniſhment, wee haue bene violentlie enforced &amp; compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the ſame againe into our boſomes, and you ſhall then perceaue, that it will bee an eaſie matter for the Pope and his hirelings, to bring the crowne of England to ſtoup vnto Antichriſts Myter. And as the lykly ruine of hir Maieſties eſtate muſt needs enſue vpon the quiet profeſſion of popery, within any parte of her dominions: ſo out of queſtion the continuance of this Hierarchye will ſo increaſe the nomber of Papiſts among vs, that of force (whether wee will or not) they will haue the libertye of their idolatrous conſciences in their Idoll ſervice. They that knowe howe their nomber haue augmented within theſe 16. yeares in our ſtate, and how Sathan hath framed his inſtruments meet for this purpoſe, may eaſilie judge that there is ſom reaſon, why this feare ſhoulde bee conceaued. The members never thinke them ſelues well placed, when they are not annexed vnto the heade. Either then remoue theſe members, or vndoubtedly they will one day, bring
<pb facs="tcp:22816:42"/>whatſoever is committed vnto their gouernment, and make the ſame ſubiect &amp; thrall vnto that head, for the ſeruice whereof they them-ſelues were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>Where it is ſaide, that the offices of Archb. and Bb. cannot ſtand in the church, without the infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the liberties thereof, and that they are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body of Antichriſt, I know it wil be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that many good men (even ſince the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing of the goſpel) ſupplied theſe places: as M. Cranmer, M. Hooper, M. Latimer, M. Ridley, M. Bale, &amp;c. whom if we ſhould account either to be vſurpers ouer their fellow brethren, and the reſt of the church of God in their time, or to haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in Antichriſtian callings, the matter will bee thought ſtrange, and hardly taken. Whervnto the anſwere is this. That for their callings, it cannot be denied but they were the offices of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian kingdome. And for the men themſelues, they coulde not poſſiblye anye wayes continue in them without the breach of Gods ordinance, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching of the libetties of the Churche in ſome meaſure. For in ſome ſort they did rather beare rule than ſerue in the miniſtery of the goſpell. And yet notwithſtanding all theſe imperfections, we think theſe men to haue bene ſuch, as for whome we are to giue the Lord harty thankes (not that they were Ll. Biſhops, but that they faithfully labored in the miniſtery of the goſpell, and ſealed the ſame with their blood. In reſpect whereof alſo wee accounte their memory to be bleſſed and reverend amongſt poſterities. But what is all this vnto the Biſhops of
<pb facs="tcp:22816:42"/>England at this day? Are they Latimers? Are they Cranmers, Ridleyes, Hoopers? Though for ſome cauſes I could wiſh they were, yet I thank God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my hart that they are not. For then their Hierarchy would not ſo ſoone fal to the ground, as now I hope it will. But alas it may grieue anye chriſtian hart, to conſider the differences that are between theſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart corrupt tyrantes, that nowe raigne ouer our church, &amp; thoſe ancient ſincere fathers. Compare them together, but onelye in one pointe, and you ſhall ſee how lamentablie they differ.</p>
            <p>Thoſe reverend men of God, M. Cranmer, M. Latimer, M. Hooper, &amp;c. hauing by great ſtriuing recovered our church (though a dead church) out of the handes of tyrannous murtherers, laboured by all meanes poſſible to put life into it by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, that being aliue, &amp; made ſtrong they might alſo reſtore it vnto liberty. Our Bb. on the other ſide what do they? Surely rather then the church vnder their juriſdictions ſhould recover hir liberty,
<note place="margin">Iudge good Readers.</note> their whole care is how they may murther the ſame. I ſclander them not. For rather than they will ſuffer any to bee over gods people, who doth inſtruct them in thoſe things that concerne the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the church, and the tyranny of the popiſh government,
<note n="*" place="margin">They haue ſtopped the mouthes of ſo many faithfull teachers within theſe 6. yeares that the proofe of this point is needleſſe.

And what is this els, but to murther the church, rather than it ſhoulde not bee in bondage vnto them. For they that bereaue the church of the word preached, take away the very life therof. The words that I haue ſpoken (ſaieth our Sauiour) are
<pb facs="tcp:22816:43"/>ſpirite and life. And I appeale in this place vnto the conſciences of our Prelates: whether if all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in England ſought the ouerthrow of their hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchie, they would not thruſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al out of their places, rather then the church ſhould be deliuered from their antichriſtian juriſdiction. It is plain they would.

The caſe therefore is manifeſt, that they loue our church ſo wel, as rather than they ſhoulde not beare rule therein, they wil ſee the hart blood of it: that being therby tamed, it may content it ſelf with any tollerable ſeruitude. Look then what differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce there may be betwene deſperate murtherers, &amp; the carefull phiſitions of mens ſoules, betweene mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles tyrants, and the pitiful fathers of the churche. &amp; the very ſame differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhal you finde, betwene our Antichriſtian Prelats now living and thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend fathers afore-named. And that the worlde may ſee how theſe our tyrants haue adulterated &amp; corrupted religion in Engl. (within theſe 20 yeares eſpecially) from the purity, wherein it was left vnto vs, not only in the writings of our Sauiour Chriſt &amp; his apoſtles, but even in their writings, whoſe ſteps our Bb. beare the world in hand that they do more neerly follow. I meane by the favor &amp; aſſiſtance of my God, to make it knowne ere it belong in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar treatiſe written for that ſpecial purpoſe.</p>
            <p>To returne vnto your Hh. again: you ſee by this
<pb facs="tcp:22816:43"/>tyme, how deteſtable the offices of L. Archb. and Bb. are in the preſence of the Lord God: &amp; you ſee that he accounteth a church government exerciſed by them to be accurſed before his Maieſty, becauſe they are the members of Antichriſts body, becauſe they beare rule lyke Lords, &amp; ſerue not as miniſters in the church. Now, do you think him &amp; his word to be enemies vnto our ſtate, becauſe they ar of this judgement? I hope you do not. How commeth it then to paſſe, that you allow not vs to ſubſcribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that truth which the Lord doth maintaine? Is it becauſe our aſſertions ar dangerous vnto the ſtate? that cannot be, vnles you account the Lord an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my therevnto: for wee affirme nothing, but that which he hath given vs commiſſion to vtter. Or is it becauſe wee behaue our ſelues ſeditiouſly in our meſſage? that cannot be proued. For the men who are moſt ſeuerely puniſhed for favoring this cauſe, haue &amp; do cary themſelues as peaceably, &amp; dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towardes her Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> and the ſtate, as any of their quality within the whole kingdom whoſoever. Ad mit it were otherwiſe: is it reaſon that you ſhoulde reiect the cauſe of God, for the faults of men? Will you deale vnjuſtly with the Lord, becauſe we deale vndutifully with the ſtate? If we be found any wiſe guilty puniſh our miſdemenor, but grant the cauſe. If you yeeld not therevnto, what do you els in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing handes vpon vs, but manifeſt your hatred vnto gods truth &amp; his people, &amp; the loue you beare vnto the antichriſtian hierarchy. Either then my Ll. you muſt needs publiſh your enimity vnto the Lord &amp; his kingdome, or you can no longer countenance
